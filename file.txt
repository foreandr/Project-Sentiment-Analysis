Omicron is not causing this. Nobody cares about covid. However, people do care about taper accelerating and rate hikes next year. Easy mode is off lads,

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,

BRP has sold every sea-doo, ski-doo, can-am, etc. They have made the past 2 years and are taking orders into 2023. HOWEVER, they cancelled evinrude right in the middle of the highest boat sales in decades, haven't significantly upped production of any of their current powersports products despite being able to sell probably %50-100 more than what they're producing, and layed off employees due to covid despite record sales and orders.

Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,
Earnings are useless this week. Sorry bruh,
Nothing interesting at least for me.,

Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,

I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative.

it go down,
Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,

Not sure why you’d jump ship. Everything is on sale right now. Time to load up and stock the pantry,
Shit I looked at it earlier in the day and saw that it was fine. Didn't know it dropped again.

Apparently it was because of Omicron? How? How does the market drop like 3 times from 3 announcements of Omicron existing. Like we get it, there's a variant. Doesn't have to be breaking news every day lol,
This video gave me blue balls,
Does anyone know what happens after the vid cuts off? Always wondered what happened,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I’d lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man… when it lets me f*ck… Christ… it’s pretty glorious.,
u/savevideo,
It doooo go dowwwwwn!,
Fun fact - If you try and send this video to your friend on Facebook Messenger it literally won't let you. It's banned for some weird reason.,
Thanks to Omicron I am now holding thousands of dollars of a penny stock instead of not a penny stock and my dumb ass wants to average down.,
Sauce for the lolz?,
It's insane.  So far Omicron has killed 0 people worldwide.  You are statistically more likely to die because of ill fitting pyjamas.  Yet the markets flip out, governments overreact, and the only shares that gain are vaccine manufacturers who sign new deals to jab up an ever shrinking number of people.,
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
Did they live? The guys in the boat?,
hahahaha. That was so funny.,
Wow,
My portfolio today ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),
SPY 420 EOY!,
Whatever fits the agenda,
CNBC thought it was Powel not taking back what he said yesterday. The variant case has minor symptoms.,
Lol what happened next!!! I want episode two!! Did some one find their stuff down stream and uploaded it ? Omg so many questions I want answers!!!!,
Is there a full length version,
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?? 🥚,
So wtf happened? Did they go over?,
Hhahahaaahaha,
Yeaaaahhh my retirement account took a shit today.,
IT DO GO DOWN!,
Sold my spy calls at 9:00 AM and was pretty resentful, but I was up 50% and didn’t want greed to get the best of me. I was really relieved when I checked when I got of work at 3.,
I wanna know what the fuck happened to these 2 later on,
I/savevideo,
Clov,
Thats more or less me these past 3 months watchin g my portfolio dip.,
Luckily I am loaded on Chinese puts and sold my spy calls this morning.,
TrAnSiToRy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
I love adamant that guy is, "**it dont**",
This is so strange… I looked at the market today and this exact moment went through my head. I even sent a gif version of this in a discord as a comment… hadn’t thought about this in years,
This dip makes me wanna buy so much shares,
Fortunately there aren’t many numbers below 0.01 so I can’t lose much more,
For me the whole year with STUPID PENN I HATE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!,
It’s Black Friday sale all week!,
Like... Where was he gonna go?,
u/savevideobot,
Perfect summary,

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
It do go down,
Does it go down lol?,
I went from up 5% to down 8%. I love being retarded👍,
The fact that almost 90% of videos that were supposed to be good are always getting cut at the good part and posted on Reddit makes my blood boil. Why is this a thing?,
It do go down!,
🎵Workin’ on a fart inside of me🎵,
NOOOO VOO down 1.4%,
Look at me, I’m the clown now

Me after buying an options call on CCL.,
Looks like the riverways in New Orleans,
*”WaLkiiNn Ooohnnn THee FiiighTen Saaihde oo’ MeEeeL”*,
I just started investing recently so this sucks for me
I have no clue how to handle this,
Wheres the full vid for diamond hands POV,
Tesla stock until Elon musk tweeted about bankrupts and stock down .01 in seconds.,
It do go down,
I don't even mind losing all that money since it meant i got this gif.,
My portfolio is diversified so my losses aren’t so bad, but damn. I went from +16% to +9% in like 3 days, 7% gone with a sneeze,
This is proving to me that long holding Vix calls is a valid strategy,
Dude ant fishing.  Fake fishing right there.,
😆😆😆😆,
I’m dying! 🤣🤣🤣,
This dip is so much I feel like I'm being waterboarded. You wouldn't do that to me daddy Powell, would you? This isn't torture. It's just a little dip.,
Lmao,
I sleep,
That looks like a [low head dam](https://practical.engineering/blog/2019/3/16/drowning-machine-the-dangers-of-low-head-dams),
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,

The stone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
Thank god I’m cash heavy right now. I’m gonna be buying heavy while things are on sale,
F in the chat,
The kid way in the back like a caveman,
Clips that end too soon,
I get it: I’m not a retarded holder, it’s just the market has those days again,
You guys think omicron is scary?

Wait until ultracron. It's ultra.,
I thought 210 was a great black Friday sale. Whoops.,
LMAOOO FR THO IT WAS DOING SO GOOD IN THE MORNING,
Huh isnt everything going up because omicron is tame apparently?,

Yeah let me drink that and just let everyone know I post here with you fucks,
Probably taste like paper hands because ppl who claim they are diamond hands are actually not diamond hands because why would they say it out loud? Ice cold ppl are the real diamond handed ppl and they don't utter a word because they are fucking savage. Paper hands scream they are diamond hands because they fear their inner fragile selves.,
For when you want to just hodl a beer.,
Two Hearted Ale from Bells, Kalamazoo Michigan,
Another brewery did it better. 16oz IPA. Way better,
Hey ken hold my beer ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
"supply chain issues" for biggest companies in the world but a nobody can slap on a label and get to distributing. Ok mr market,

I saw one a while ago called [DeepF*%#ingValue](https://untappd.com/b/hourglass-brewing-deepf-ingvalue/4203130),
Ofcourse it’s an IPA,
New England where men are still men,
I'm in Boston,, where do I get one?,
Probably taste like neckbeard sweat,

Cheers!,

I am not sure if its because my positions are completely retarded this time around, but the kangaroo market was much more fun the last time around.,

Powell: "You don't think I'll fuck your spreads?",
Yeah; I think the last year has been a pig market, not a bull market.

Now it’s a snake market… sneaky reptiles slithering around waiting to bite you in the ass mid-day without warning.

Or maybe it’s an alligator snapping turtle market… it’s a big sea; we are little fish that see what looks like food on the turtles tongue.  We are too stupid to know the turtle will eat us when we take the bait.

Bait?  Bait and switch?  Is it a hooker’s market, or a crackwhore market???… Rough night?  Ah, hell… just bump up again and get ready to be fucked again, in all the wrong places and in the worst ways.,
A classic meme.,
Vaccine effectiveness remains to be seen against the Omicron variant but even if it decreases there is still a possibility it could be comparable to the flu vaccine effectiveness of 40-60%. If comorbidity is the same or less than Delta I don’t see why markets would not bounce back from a large over reaction. BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!,
KAPITALISMUS! SCHWEINESYSTEM!,
