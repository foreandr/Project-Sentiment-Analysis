Roommate came to my room, said he heard a bunch of people applauding. But it was just me getting my cheeks clapped  üëè,
Lost 35k this week and got flagged as day trader. U win some boys but lose most.,
cant believe we were making fun of bears just this morning,
SPY was 2% up and now more than -1% down.

so fucking crazy,
Today was a perfect example of why futures don‚Äôt matter. You can be up 2% at open and close 2% down. Literally no point in watching futures all night.,
One of the many worst days in recent times,
12:15pm: "I think I'll nap. Armageddon is more fun when you wake up in it."

4:15pm: "Well, that was a nice nap. Are we in Armageddon yet?"

4:20pm: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
I think I was happier back in prison.,
You know there is **at least one retard here** that did these moves in the last 5 trading days:  
  
1. Bought calls last Wednesday (Front running Santa rally)  
2. Switched to puts last Friday (Omicron fears)  
3. Switched to calls on Monday (Omicron being a nothingburger)  
4. Switched to puts yesterday (Jpow inflation comments)  
5. Switched to calls this morning (Seeing the Futures rally)  
6. Switched to puts at close today (first Omicron case in the US)  
  
Show up, because you deserved to be a mod here!,
Hypothetically, is it insider trading if I load up on a bunch of SPY puts, visit the New York Stock Exchange while I know I have the Omicron variant, and pass out in public?,
Game over. Insert coin to play again.,
If it's possible for a stock to go negative, my money is on WISH.,

Lost $10k last year. Recovered all and got $8k on top of it this year, only to lose $20k this year. The fuck,
I buy calls ... stock crashes.  I buy puts..stocks fkn skyrocket.   I fkn give up.,
Media be like Omicron this Omicron that.... and I'm just here like look at Omi-losses ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Honestly think this market has ruined me. Financially and mentally. Have been doing this full time two years. Last year was great, now I‚Äôm legit red for the year. I had many chances too but nope just kept holding my calls too long or selling the gold ones too fucking early. Wow this hurts. I feel so unmotivated. I‚Äôm a loser,

I deposited 3 grand on monday, its gone today lmao,
buddy of mine was up like 40% this year on 9K principle doing his gambling stock theta plays (selling CCs and cash secured puts) and is now down like 5% for the year.

He basically went from a 12K account to 8K just on shares. Yikes.,

The year is 2420. SPY has been ripping back and forth between 450 and 465 every day for like 400 years. You wake up, put your helmet on, and plug yourself into the Robinhood(TM) metaverse for another day of alternating between panic selling and euphoria.  You haven't left your pod in months. What a rush. 

SPY opens at 450 and immediately starts blasting green dildos. You take a long slurp of soy-product through your feeding tube and turn your extra small fleshlight to "maximum-stim." You were born for this shit. Today's gonna be a great day.,

Wait last I checked SPY was at +$8 for the day WHAT ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),

Me: I‚Äôm tired of losing money! 

Market: Well that‚Äôs too damn bad!,
Goddamn I never take profits,
Well that was fucking BAD. 

Have we seen a sell-off that bad since the pandemic started? Maybe September 3rd 2020. Any other time since? 

What are the bullish arguments at this point? Considering that Omicron is probably just a catalyst and not the driving force behind the sell off...,
Took a nice little nap. Woke up poor. Dafuq,
80% of the stocks were in bear market anyways. Now the remaining 20% will join them.,
Guys, Friday was puts, Monday was Calls, Tuesday was puts, Today was Calls, then puts, so tomorrow will be puts then calls.

How are you guys not rich?,
WHO HELD THEIR SPY CALLS EXPIRING TODAY AND GOT FKED,
This week is really good, I‚Äôm already up -270% of all time,
jpow timed his "inflation isnt transitory and we can accelerate the QE taper by a few months" talk right at the same time as omnicron so that we can all blame the virus over markets dropping

the shift bastard,
Opened up 77k worth of SPX puts on 11/1 for Dec 17 and watched it theta decay slowly for a month, finally exited with 50% gains today, got 150k in cash gang,
If that was a bull trap then it was beautifully done,
Just watched the selling pressure blow through a 4.5 million dollar buy order on SPY üëÄ,
VIX at 31 is spooky af,
Not to be outdone, Roblox changes name to Rotesseract,

Serious question - what is the catalyst bulls expect for SPY going back to ATH say any timeframe longer than a month? 

We already heard the truth from the fed. Tapering schedule is moving up which means rate hikes will be moved up ahead of schedule as well. Inflation must be combated. 

The Omnicron variant is nothing more than the current scapegoat to create bag holders as they run for the exit in the coming months.,
Realized 22k in losses today. These weren't just for today alone. These were shares that I've stubbornly bagheld for months. It doesn't matter what I do. Vanilla OTM FD gambling, theta, shares, I always lose short term investments. It's so frustrating. I'm close deciding to just buy some shares of AMD, AAPL and other relatively safe companies, and not checking my account for a decade. In the meantime, I'll probably have to update my software engineering skills and actually look for a job like some wageslave.,

Yesterday was high af on shrooms and found myself being attracted to my reflection in the mirror, and then I had to check if I was male or female, and was relieved to find a dick in my pants, but at the same time, it left me wondering about something: does this whole scenario make me a bear?,
I‚Äôll be damned if we break 200D. This is definitely a correction. It is unrelated to virus or any other BS reasons being claimed by the media. It‚Äôs nothing more than a healthy 5-7% correction.

Not a financial advice, I‚Äôm retarded.,
Do bears nut to omicron news??,
Usually I like to buy at the top.  But sometimes I sell at the bottom just to switch it up.,

Having shares in this market is like being in a cozy warm house in the middle of a storm, knowing that if you stay inside you‚Äôll be fine. Having calls is like being in that same storm in a run away car with a methed up raccoon from Florida at the drivers seat repeatedly dry humping the wheel.,

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,

- SNOW Jan 330p

Whaddaya think of that?,
Should I go all in on zumiez puts right before the closing bell?,
I‚Äôm getting a very bullish vibe from ULTA. The last earnings they had, they crushed it!,
Anyone holding CRM through earnings? I am thinking puts but I may be wrong.,
After seeing what happened to CRM I don't want to touch Okta..,
Thinking Docusign puts?,

Asana please don't hurt me too bad,
Hold up. I‚Äôm unbanned? Aye my 1 week is up. Puts on all Chinese stocks it is,
This is a difficult play given that several stocks might be influenced from he short term news

The position im less confident is the one on DOCU as the stock might benefit from new lockdowns,

Thoughts on DOLE puts?,
Red Week vibes from these guys,
BRP has sold every sea-doo, ski-doo, can-am, etc. They have made the past 2 years and are taking orders into 2023. HOWEVER, they cancelled evinrude right in the middle of the highest boat sales in decades, haven't significantly upped production of any of their current powersports products despite being able to sell probably %50-100 more than what they're producing, and layed off employees due to covid despite record sales and orders.

The powersports market was so Bullish but I can't be on BRP with their management.,
Which one of these chinese stocks am i getting puts on?,
Dollar general, that one should be easy to predict,
DOCU has dropped pretty hard the last two weeks but I imagine they‚Äôll hit earnings targets. Might see a nice bounce back this week,

Looking at Box before earnings. What we thinking?,
What do you all think about calls right before closing on salesforce,
smith and weston yolo initiated,
What‚Äôs the play for $SNOW and $DOCU?,
Yes!!!,
AMBA fueling up !!,
Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,
Earnings are useless this week. Sorry bruh,
Nothing interesting at least for me.,
Calls on JNCO Jeans,
Hmmm calls on CRWD a good move? Looks like ZS had good earnings but valuation seems real high,
Every "crisis" we have had over the past decade is one step back three step forward for the stock markets.,
put season,
With today‚Äôs sell off, SNOW calls are very attractive üöÄüöÄüöÄ,
There has to be some rotation back into some of these stocks that are getting absolutely crushed.,
I have heard of 6 companies on this list.,
why didn't I play snowflake. I have never heard of it and I'm in tech.,
Puts on SNOW. This company is priced at an insane price to sales for building cloud databases (60s tech but on the cloud). Even a slight miss and this is plummeting.,
DIDNT WE AGREE WE WERENT DOING THIS BULLSHIT ANYMORE?,
Ulta %20 otm puts for like 5$ hope for a %30 drop bank on 100x loto,
Snow. Up or down?,
CRM is a must buy after today‚Äôs pullback üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,
CRWD melting is making me wonder about my 200p 12/3s.,
SNOW beats, plus $40 after hours,
There‚Äôs always money in the banana stand
$dole,
No cool stocks,
Hope ASAN tank like PTON,
Put on lucid?,
$GFS, really interested to see their earnings. I‚Äôm primarily bearish on the company but this earnings could be a huge trajectory shift for them,
I just be it all on LCID puts. Am I fuxd?,
$CRWD has to be a no brainer based on $ZS sympathy? Going to grab a few lottos at close.,
Banked good from day trading CRWD puts today and closed it before earnings 

What‚Äôs a good day trade for options tomorrow?,
Someone posted bzun puts are easy money. Cheap too. Thoughts?,
Jinko hoe,

Jinko jeans were my favorite in high school,
Puts on all. Every day all day,
$SWBI is the short and long term play my apes. P/E ratio is 5 or something. Fear of lockdowns will pump it this week,
Fuck. Should've bought Ulta when I had the chance.,
Not "most anticipated", but I have high hopes for JOAN on Dec 2nd,
Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,
Calls on Zscaler? They seem to have increased hiring of late.,
I‚Äòm new. What can I do with that information?,
Ispc on monday üöÄüöÄüöÄüé∞üé∞üéâüéâ,

"It do go down" üòÇü§£üòÇ Classic video!,
When you buy the dip but it just keeps dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
See y‚Äôall on the other side son! üòÇ,
It was amazing how quickly that announcement just tanked everything.,
r/gifsthatendtoosoon,
I went from +1500 USD to -3000 USD and a spam of margin calls from my broker.. Ahh shit, here we go again,
My portfolio is running away from the market.,
My bad guys, had my first foray into stocks buying ¬£5 of Costco on Friday. Isn't there supposed to be beginners luck?,
I've never seen past this point of this video. Anyone have the extended version?,
If Ive learned anything from our little adventures this year, it's that Im happier shorting bad stock than longing any good ones....,
It's fucking CRM down 11 percent,
I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative. 

What the fuck is going on?,
The Merle Haggard is the funniest bit,
crashing hard i am running out of cash to buy the upcoming dips,
it go down,
Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,
Fucking pussies,
Lmao!!!!!  It do go down,
Look guys, this is just another chance to buy at massive discounts if you couldn't last Friday because you were too hung over.,
When life gives you dip make chips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
This video is funny as fuck.,
This video gave me blue balls,
Say it with me now diverse , diverse , diverse,
Did they live? The guys in the boat?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
The funny thing is, in the original video they hit the wall and they never go down.,
thank god i didnt buy nothin today,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
hahahaha. That was so funny.,
Wow,
Does anyone know what happens after the vid cuts off? Always wondered what happened,
I upvoted for the video alone. Not because I'm fucking holding bags,
My portfolio today ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),
Now this is a quality meme.,
SPY 420 EOY!,
Whatever fits the agenda,
were they okay?,
where is?,
CNBC thought it was Powel not taking back what he said yesterday. The variant case has minor symptoms.,
Lol what happened next!!! I want episode two!! Did some one find their stuff down stream and uploaded it ? Omg so many questions I want answers!!!!,
Is there a full length version,
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?? ü•ö,
Apparently it do go down. Glad for once I wasn‚Äôt retarded and closed my calls for a 10% loss instead of holding. Then I bought puts.. Anyone else fuck up on puts today? Had to leave for work at 145pm ish, closed my 12/3 462P‚Äôs when SPY hit 458 ü§°,
So wtf happened? Did they go over?,
Hhahahaaahaha,
Yeaaaahhh my retirement account took a shit today.,
IT DO GO DOWN!,
Sold my spy calls at 9:00 AM and was pretty resentful, but I was up 50% and didn‚Äôt want greed to get the best of me. I was really relieved when I checked when I got of work at 3.,
I wanna know what the fuck happened to these 2 later on,
I/savevideo,
Clov,
Thats more or less me these past 3 months watchin g my portfolio dip.,
Luckily I am loaded on Chinese puts and sold my spy calls this morning.,
TrAnSiToRy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
I love adamant that guy is, "**it dont**",
This is so strange‚Ä¶ I looked at the market today and this exact moment went through my head. I even sent a gif version of this in a discord as a comment‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt thought about this in years,
This dip makes me wanna buy so much shares,
Fortunately there aren‚Äôt many numbers below 0.01 so I can‚Äôt lose much more,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I‚Äôd lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man‚Ä¶ when it lets me f*ck‚Ä¶ Christ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty glorious.,
For me the whole year with STUPID PENN I HATE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!,
It‚Äôs Black Friday sale all week!,
Like... Where was he gonna go?,
u/savevideobot,

Perfect summary,
My shop calls are bleedinnnnnggggg,

Feels lmao,
Puts galore today it was great,
Made like 3k on $MRNA puts lol,
#Evergrande,
Why the camera man sound like Dunkey,
what did i do to deserve this dip...,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
It do go down,
Does it go down lol?,
I went from up 5% to down 8%. I love being retardedüëç,
The fact that almost 90% of videos that were supposed to be good are always getting cut at the good part and posted on Reddit makes my blood boil. Why is this a thing?,
It do go down!,
üéµWorkin‚Äô on a fart inside of meüéµ,
NOOOO VOO down 1.4%,
Look at me, I‚Äôm the clown now

Me after buying an options call on CCL.,
Looks like the riverways in New Orleans,
*‚ÄùWaLkiiNn Ooohnnn THee FiiighTen Saaihde oo‚Äô MeEeeL‚Äù*,
I just started investing recently so this sucks for me
I have no clue how to handle this,
Wheres the full vid for diamond hands POV,
Tesla stock until Elon musk tweeted about bankrupts and stock down .01 in seconds.,
It do go down,
I don't even mind losing all that money since it meant i got this gif.,
My portfolio is diversified so my losses aren‚Äôt so bad, but damn. I went from +16% to +9% in like 3 days, 7% gone with a sneeze,
This is proving to me that long holding Vix calls is a valid strategy,
Dude ant fishing.  Fake fishing right there.,
üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ,
I‚Äôm dying! ü§£ü§£ü§£,
This dip is so much I feel like I'm being waterboarded. You wouldn't do that to me daddy Powell, would you? This isn't torture. It's just a little dip.,
this is how I found out my entire portfolio is red today,
u/savevideobot,
It doooo go dowwwwwn!,
DWAC blowing up.,
Market aside, I'm kinda worried about those dudes in that video irl,

My stocks all tanked.,
omicron has the coolest name,
My blood red portfolio would like to disagree.,
Apparently the stock market cares since all I'm seen is red on this b!tch market,
It is easily.


Also, where are the GAINS!?,
If only they didn't skip the previous letter : "Look, the Xi Variant !",
I want you to know I blame this meme for today,
Narrator:  It wasn‚Äôt.,
r/agedlikemilk,
AGED LIKE MILK.,
They will skip naming future versions the Xi variant, because you know, it would imply China.,
My take is whoever is naming strains has a hard on for Transformers and Decepticons,
Man, these stocks are going down faster than my wife in a room full of bank executives.,
Only took 7 hours for this to age like milk.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
*Laugh in my aeronautics company share*,
In OPs defense he did say ‚ÄúHopefully‚Äù,
This aged like cheese,
This aged horribly....,
This shit aged like milk 7 hours later. Lol,
Welk, this post hasn‚Äôt aged well,
/r/agedlikemilk,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Powell said inflation is a bigger risk to the economy, new variant + he will be more hawkish towards sooner inflation = bull trap don‚Äôt play bros!,
Everywhere but the MSM and Twitter,
President Omicron of Chyna is pretty upset about it...,
volatility says otherwise,
Aged like wine,
If nobody cares what the hell happened to the market once they announced the first case here in Cali...

My apple calls went to shit mid day...,
This is actually pretty 50/50. It‚Äôs guesstimated at this point that it‚Äôs more contagious that delta, which is expected with variations. 

If omicron is more lethal, it could mean more restrictions and a juicy market dip. Buttttt if the symptoms are less severe (like a cold equivalent) it could outcompete covid to where this variant is all that‚Äôs left and essentially end the pandemic with a covid cold season. Big market pumps. This situation may be why the market is stagnant about this.,
I think without widespread lockdowns it won't cause more than a few red days here and there on news that it's getting worse, etc. If new lockdowns are announced, then people might lose their shit.,
Do you guys watch the market or..?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
It‚Äôs not the new variant that‚Äôs crashing the market. 

Our retarded politicians reactions to it are.,
Japan forcing airline industry not to book new flights.  Ramp up the fear train.,
Spoke too soon,
The market appears to care :/,
I‚Äôd be much more worried about a Theta variant with the way theta always fucks me on FDs.,
This is so relatable. The varients will never cease at this point.,
I went to the gym yesterday and I think it was more packed then it ever was pre-COVID. No one gives a shit. 95% of people take their mask off after their 3 steps past the front desk.,
Wow that omicron actor is a sex offender!,
Big oooff.,
Literally every public health expert: The omicron variant is almost certainly in every single major country including the US

Market: I sleep

News report comes out confirming what every public health expert said.

Market: Real shit,
Jesus Christ there are literally THOUSANDS of variants floating out there. It's a virus, it constantly mutates. It's what it does. If the market keeps on shitting itself everytime someone around the world coughs, then its more retarded than me, and my mother dropped me on the head.,
honestly i havent cared about covid for what feels like years,
this confirms my bias,
I work in the department of pathology and have a PhD in biochemistry.  I want to get the following information  to as many people as I can.

For the most part viruses follow an evolutionary path to being less and less harmful but more infectious.  Odds are extremely likely that this variant will be the least deadly/dangerous variant so far, but may spread  better.

Now nothing is certain until the data is officially out, but i wouldn't be too surprised if omicron is already in the usa and is just so much less of a problem that its not being detected.  No deaths by omicron has been documented world wide:  [https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/11/29/1059723751/omicron-variant-latest-high-risk-world-health-organization](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/11/29/1059723751/omicron-variant-latest-high-risk-world-health-organization)

MSM is literally fear mongering for clicks and to push vaccines to help big pharmas bottom line.,
Lost me at delta, omicron was the nail in the coffin. Now I don't give a fuck. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
I don't care about omicron üòáü§ë,
What happened to Evergrande?,
Omicron sounds like a villain in a cheesy cartoon! Let‚Äôs treat as such and never watch it and completely ignore the bullshit üíéüôåü¶ç,
As a Floridian (born, not by choice), we haven't given a FUCK since like July, 2020,
Media wants people to panic even though we don't know shit yet. It's a sad state as usual.,
This post didn't age so well.,
When Fauci and Biden both couldn't pronounce it right, u knew it wasn't a big deal.,
Considering that omicron symptoms are basically cold symptoms, and that the common cold is technically also a coronavirus.... Yeah.,
Who knew viruses mutated?!,
tell that to my AAL calls.,
everything i'm seeing out of SA studies is showing reduced symptoms.  less lethality.,
Isn‚Äôt that the name of the planet Lurr the big green alien king from futurama is from?,
uh huh,
Guess you haven't seen the market for the last week...,
Why can‚Äôt we get variants of good stuff too?,
Y'all do remember he DIES in the end, right.,
Nobody vaccinated cares‚Ä¶,
The data that is coming seems to indicate that omicron has a lower mortality than the current most prominent variant delta.,
Spy Bounce off 50 day or previous low. I don‚Äôt see more than that. BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!,
Wait I'm not yet done buying the dips,
RULER OF OMICRON PERSEI 8,
apparently not,
I wish I knew this morning what I know now.,
New covid DLC? Pog!,
Its here to stay like the flu. I'm gonna get shots probably because I don't wanna lose my smell but  yeah who cares at this point all the people at risk can easily access the care they want.,
Omnicron is actually super bullish for markets. If the reports are true and it is high transmission but low death rate, it will become endemic as the dominant covid and will just be like a new flu. Things will ACTUALLY get back to normal.,
Oh no we have to keep wearing masks and distancing as opposed to before where we were wearing masks and distancing,
Lol omicron virus is less lethal than the prior ones. The future variants will probably decrease in lethality as time progresses, some of y‚Äôall need to chill,
Dude I thought you guys just liked silver,
People are more worried about how governments will react with lockdowns etc,
Wonder when is theta coming.,
Oh jeez. Guess I‚Äôll just have another minor sinus infection soon despite vaccines and boosters and hand sanitizer.,
I can‚Äôt wait until the harsher travel restrictions biden is supposed to put in place tomorrow!,
True everyone is going to catch it let‚Äôs just stop,
This aged well,
We‚Äôll see tomorrow as the first case in California,
Fuck the govt.,
RemindMe! One Year,
Well one stock for me was down QSR -10.85 over all and my others were up for most of the day,
It‚Äôs crazy how hard the msm fear mongers over something that has happened so many times already.. it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúHORRY SheEt! Why is it so dark already?‚Äù It‚Äôs not like the earth has seasons or anything.. fucking retards,
It's almost as bad a being spammed to death by crypto and WSB bullshit,
Inflation is fake. Omicron dogshit. I‚Äôm crying in pain rn. Plz pump‚Ä¶,
Stock market cares apparently,
Fast forward 2 weeks, well timmy's dad passed away. Guess he should have cared,
Narrator voice: It wasnt the sentiment,
Bad take.,
My life has been back to normal (or at least like 95% normal) since April. I'm going to do my booster at some point in the next week. I'm literally not worried about this from a personal health standpoint, since I've only been sick once in my adult life, and from an economic standpoint, stock prices falling means retirement is on sale.,
I can‚Äôt help but think the caption should be 

Omicron omicron we got omicron here

See nobody cares.,
Didn't age well.,
This aged badly,
Literally this was the same reaction when COVID first became a thing. But aight,
But also the same guy who said: "Hello, nice boy. Uh, nice boy. Nice dinosaur. I thought you were one of your big brothers, you're not so bad. You're not so bad.",
Just wait until the decepticon variant kicks in. Then we‚Äôre fucked.,
It‚Äôs the sentiment about covid in general in Texas,
What the hell does this have to do with wallstreetbets,
It's not the sentiment. Damn paper hands out there selling like crazy.,
My losses say they still very much care.,
Under 40 you have a higher chance to die choking on food but jab me harder daddy ü§°,
Alright we need mass movement here. Fuck covid. Let's move on.,
Seriously, who gives a flying fuck anymore, let alone ever imho.,
Who knew we‚Äôd be more immune to FUD.,
It is for me and most people I know. Really with all the variants. Since I don't hang out with too many 'progressives', I don't have that whiny, nagging, pro-pharma loving atmosphere around.,
People are getting tired of this crap.

A lot of people are going to get butt hurt over this in 2022.

Others will sit back and enjoy watching the fallout.

.,
Should have been since day 1 tbh. ‚ÄúStay away from people that are sick!‚Äù Funny how there‚Äôs a new ‚Äúvariant‚Äù that has even more cold-like symptoms seemingly every season that most people get a cold.

Edit: added should have,
Thought I was looking at the first meme of a HermanCainAward winner.,
It's so nice to see how the average person is no longer falling for the media's fearmongering to get clicks as much as they were before.,
Literally the post above yours on my feed... https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/r6e60b/sigh\_of\_relief\_in\_south\_africa\_as\_omicron\_variant/,
....Or we could stop blowing the dog whistles of vaccine mandates, mask mandates, etc

And, instead actually bother to prepare for something before it fucking arrives.

Smart decisions give you no reason to panic.,
NOBODY CARES‚Ä¶. Except FAKE NEWSüíØ,
The media can go fuck it self now,
It‚Äôs been my sentiment since the beginning. No masks, no shots, no changes to my lifestyle, never been sick and neither has anyone else in my family. 

Main reason this matters is what will J-pow do.,
Too bad redditors on certain subs are actively hoping it‚Äôs a bad variant lol,
Its not the variant that were all afraid of, its the radical government reaction to it that is frightening,
Definitely my sentiment,
There will always be a new variant as soon as you all seem to be getting on with your lives.,
Yes, it is the sentiment. They blew their wad trying to frighten and control the world on the first attempt.,
I wish I could downvote this more than once,
It is for me üòÇ fuck all these variants,
Only people who care are the Covid  Narcissist, you know, the ones that wear a mask inside their car while driving alone and shame you for not doing the same.,
Lots of ignorance in this thread sheesh. If you are refusing to get vaccinated please refuse to enter a hospital as well, vermin.,
It becomes more and more apparent to me with each post like this that zjz only gets triggered when people talk bad about Republicans.

Imagine not caring about a development in an ongoing pandemic lmao. Probably the people who haven‚Äôt cared enough about it all along to get vaccinated or wear masks. Can‚Äôt be bothered to do anything to help out, but ask ‚Äúcan‚Äôt this shit be over already :(((‚Äú.,
Get your vaccine, keep aping on. Don't get the vaccine: you get sick, lung damage, go on ventilator, die before seeing the MOASS.,
Seeing as they've never even proved ANY of the other 'variants' to exist, yeah this is now the attitude. 

In fact, this is how I've felt the entire time, about the entire 'pandemic'. 

Imagine a pandemic so deadly, it doesn't affect annual excess deaths AT ALL, and you need to be tested to even know you have it,
Wow This must be where the real people live in Reddit,
It‚Äôs pretty simple why. If you‚Äôre vaccinated, this variant isn‚Äôt any worse, so no reason to worry any more. If you‚Äôre not vaccinated, despite it being worse on you than delta, you probably don‚Äôt care anyway. Didn‚Äôt care enough to get vaccinated in the first place, why start now?,
1st US case detected in California.,
Everyone I know is so sick and tired of covid even tho they are vaccinated,

I‚Äôve had AMD for years and it‚Äôs been a wild ride. I liquidated my original investment worth a couple times over and still have 3x riding,
Congratulations that‚Äôs awesome‚Ä¶and fuck you,

You sold high? What‚Äôs wrong with you?,
Congratulations, now please go yolo in tsm like me!,
Good for u bro. Now take some of that out and buy urself something nice before ur next yolo lol.,
‚ÄúAnd what happened, then? Well, in r/wallstreetbets they say ‚Äì that u/CaspeanSea 's smooth brain grew three wrinkles that day. And then ‚Äì the true meaning of being retarded came through, and u/CaspeanSea found the account of 5 baggers, plus two!‚Äù,
Perfect timing I just bought it yesterday,
nice, I remember doing covered calls with AMD when it was around 80 dollars and it just got assigned sometime in summer at around 100 and I thought "meh it won't keep going up" and boy am I a fucking moron.,
Bruh god damn,
Stay blessed king,
Can't be mad about that! We can... but you can't. Congrats retard.,
Now Short it and really double dip  üòçüòç,
I think some people meant to buy and AMD and accidentally bought AMC,
https://i.imgur.com/eTM17eJ.jpg  I see your 700% and raise you my 947%!,
Today I lost 66,000 on my main ccount. glad to see you took the opposite side of my bet. proper job,

Also holding on and. Congratulations and fuck you,
Exercise them fgt,

well deserved my friend some real motivation,
How dare you post something green that isn't a robinhood loss!,
Good for you man, all mine have expired worthless. Please don‚Äôt tell the wife‚Äôs boyfriend I lost all his money.,
I touch myself,
Keep the $280 call,
total newb, can someone explain what's going on here? I think I understand the mechanics of a long call ‚Äì you buy the option to buy at a set price. But I'm not understanding the figures in the 'Position' column (the amount of options bought at that $?) and how it corresponds to the total cost.

Does this basically mean /u/CaspeanSea was buying calls for December in January?,
Congratulatory and obligatory fuck you :),
Smart man. Congrats on that. Im pissed at myself for selling my shares at 45bucks. Big mistake.,
If  it is good enough to screen shot, it is good enough to sell.

&#x200B;

Congratulations,
I jumped in at the low 70s and dipped at the high 80s. I thought I did pretty well and then looked at it a few weeks later and it was sitting in the 100s haha. 

Oh well, be glad for the money you made. Not mad at the money you didn't.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Wtf? Take profit?

Can someone ELI5 the concept of taking profit?,
Well done sir,
I had these same calls, doubled my account since September. Congrats man,
Congratulations bro, let me know if you want to start a small cap garage investment firm.,
Well fucking done brah,
Should I keep my $135c 2023? The market is starting to worry me, I‚Äôm up a lot though.,
One should never argue with profit! Congratulations Sir,
When did you initiate the position and did you average down?,
Nice, had the $90 calls, got weak hands and sold at $50. Still have my shares though.,
That's some nice juicy profit you got  there. Christmas is coming up, better start shopping for your wife's BF.,
Consider yourself realized you fucker! Cheers,
U sold early bro,
What a good timing. Good job.,
One of my NCOs bought 10000 shares of AMD when it was 2 a share back in January 2018. He is still holding,
amazing when did you originally buy the calls?,
Wow whateverrr,
Sold before the Xilinex deal?,
Ive been sitting on mine since it was $5/share. It is too bad I didn't buy wayyy more. =/,
OP send $800 bucks for my rent. Thanks.,

My favorite story so far regarding omicron is the two israeli doctors that went to south africa to get omicron viral stocks, didnt get any samples and returned testing positive for the variant.

At least they managed to return with the virus for their labs :\^),
Did anyone seriously think it wasn't already in the US?,
The Omicronians are coming to harvest your Human horns,
So how long will it take to infect all of US? Plague.inc says 9months,
Wouldn't bears be happy as things are now sinking?,
Who gives a shit.,
I am SHOCKED it‚Äôs in the US, would have never thought that would happen ü§°,
I'd be real careful betting on much impact from this. I think it's a one or two day impact on the market, at most,
So where was patient zero? Italy? Africa? You don't know because you're a bad father!,
Lmao based Reddit? Never heard of this,
Im pretty sure Omicron died in the last transformers movie,
Who gives a shit. Covid panic is so 2020.,
Oh no!

Anyways...,
Good thing I invested heavily in Playboy. Everyone will stay at home jerking it. The stock can only go up,
Bullish, I just bought TQQQ calls as soon as I heard. We're pumping stocks to the moon!,
Haven't you heard? Already priced in.,
It‚Äôs wild they‚Äôre saying that person tested positive for Omicron 2 days ago but also that the tests can‚Äôt tell the difference between variants & it takes a lab 2 weeks,
First case of the harmless variant.,
Well whop-ti-fucking-do, no one gives a shit anymore. Fuck off Covid!,
How is this a surprise. 

It will pass just like delta and the other covid shit.


Buy the dip pussies,
DOOR DASH CALLS NOW,
Fuck CNN anyways,
thats it we are all doomed.,
Why are people that dumb? It‚Äôs second slide on the same news. The human race deserves to be extinct,
I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is. Each year we get a flu shot and each year we end up getting it anyways. There are variants each year and Covid will be part of the norm from now on. But what does this mean for the market?? Start buying shorts??,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Completely transitory.,
To get into Canada you need to be vaxxed and show negative test results yet omicron still got in. I'm thinking tunnels a la el chapo. Only way ü§£,
Everyone already knew it was here and only a matter of time till it was detected.

Also, no one gives a fuck. No shutdowns, no lockdowns, no fucks given by literally anyone.,
I am Lurrrrr!,
# ITS TIME TO ACTIVATE THAT ACCOUNT BIG SHORT MICHAEL,
"Be afraid, be very afraid" Is all they ever want us to be. C\*nts.,
Oh no! A variant with very mild symptoms.  Let's sell everything off and screw everyone.  WTF,
Honestly the best solution is to ignore the whole covid shit, I am personally tired of it and I think many are even if their too afraid to speak up!
Protect the elderly and let the world move on with their lives.

The only positive in my opinion is making piles of money on the way down and the way up due to reaction in the market.,
So, what a big deal about it? For that no one needs to be panicked. I believe the market crashing today was a calculated move by the Hedge funds. One single event cannot dictate the market. The poor fellas sell losing their investments and the Hedge funds will buy at cheap and sell again at high prices.,
Oh no another survivable flu with milder symptoms. I‚Äôm so scaredü§™,
Wait til Megatron gets here.,
How did it take so long to identify Chris Cuomo?,
CNN got Omicron! üò≤,
Good! Let‚Äôs get this shit over with so we can get back to some green! 

PS: heard that current vaccines are effective against omicron and symptoms are not severe.,
Gets worried üòß 

Sees it‚Äôs cnn üòØ

Oh thank goodness it‚Äôs not true, we‚Äôre safe! ü•≤,
Don't listen to CNN, they lie a lot,
If there's 1 case, there's already thousands. Besides which, like the common cold, covid is mutating towards being more infectious and more benign. Omicron will have a survivability rate for unvaxxed people of 99.9999586% or something.,
This News was baked in on Monday.,
We better get our 10th booster shot!!!,

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/14/scientists-admit-totalitarian-use-fear-control-behaviour-covid/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/14/scientists-admit-totalitarian-use-fear-control-behaviour-covid/),
They should call omicron what it really is. The midterm mail in ballot virus,
Omicron: more contagious but almost zero lethal.,
This is a fucking joke ‚ÄúTHE FIRST CASE OF OMICRON‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a fucking anthrax mega death virus that I craft in Plague Inc. Jesus the media and the spread of information is legitimately bad as retarded fuck faces make mass fear mongering a daily occurrence.,
This is a nothing burger. Just another chance for the government to seize more control. The S African doctor that discovered this variant said the symptoms were very mild and no one had been hospitalized. It‚Äôs time for the American people to say enough is enough. No more fucking lockdowns. No more masks and shot mandates. Neither of those two stopped the virus from spreading. And yet, they keep pushing.,
Get your 107th vaccine booster shot today. Pfizer loves you,
A WHOLE ENTIRE CASE!,
Covid chumps and their money will soon be parted. I guess they will sell every time there is a new Greek letter. Have fun losing your money algorithms trading on your panicky feelings.,
It was found in California. You know the same state that is stopping the ships from unloading, wanting to keep lock downs in affect, has all the homeless and addicts that aren't vaccinated but don't die, high taxes and all around shit hole. I don't believe in the biden germ being what they claim it to be.,
Mazel tov,
ermahgern!,
Glad I got those carnival puts!,
Come on they‚Äôre just trying to give you a better long term deal/investment on your stocks. üòâ,
Man imagine being that muhfucca people looking at you like you muhfucca,
Lol....Jesus this circus won't stop....,
Im not a scientist, but I learned in HS viruses mutate all the time.  A few months ago we were being scared with a more deadly and more contagious Delta variant.  Now this new Omicron.   Im starting to think its all bull shit.  People die of flu every year.,
Ah yes the omicrock-a-shit variant,
Oh no the black plague,
I think omicron has the media spotlight because of the markets / money that it affects. And it affects the markets because it has the media spotlight.,
.... Bears in the gay community? I'm missing something,
Puts on airlines,
It's a bear trap, everybody seems to have forgotten what happened half a year ago with the Delta variant. News of a new Variant of Concern went mainstream on Friday 7th May (the name Delta was only assigned on 31st May). From Friday high to Wednesday low SPY sank from 422,82 to 404,00. Bear Pride parades were being arranged, $ROPE was overbought. On 4th June SPY reached new ATH.

Stonks only go up and in the worst case daddy JPOW will just switch the infinite money printer on overdrive.,
CNN is Garbage,
Feels like Feb 2020 all over. Deja Vu confirmed!,
I can‚Äôt believe the panic level.  Damn,
What do the first two emoji‚Äôs mean?,
HOLD ME,
Anyone else find it weird that the omicron just popped up right before the ghislaine maxwell trail and now all the news is about corona and not her trialüßê,
Omicron can suck my diamond handed dick,
Who actually cares at this point I am sick of these pansies clowns power grabbing off a flu varient every day we see images of these people breaking their own rules ... Just sayin,
Ah glad I picked up aapl puts at the top rip spy calls,
Even a wannabe üåàüêª such as myself is not that excited about this.  How many variants have we come across to date, there is a small short term correction and the bulls go back to taking indexes to new highs by the end of the week.  I want a real sale on some of my favourite things before Christmas so my stockings are full of Telsa's, Amazons and Apples.,
CNN sent an intern to Africa, caught omicron, came back and bam first case.,
Not like I expected any different from this sub, but the amount of misinformation and dumbasses in the comments is astounding.,
Imagine still being a pussy about COVID,
That‚Äôs misspelled, it‚Äôs ‚Äú omiCON.,
Yeah; I think hedge fund supercomputers found the news before media reported on it.  This explains the sell-off.

Ughh‚Ä¶ sobering reminder that COVID is nowhere near finished.

I dunno; I‚Äôm gonna sit out of the market for a few weeks b/c the market action has been insane the last week‚Ä¶ I think it is beyond the point anyone can even reasonable have any idea where it‚Äôs going to go (which is already not an exact science‚Ä¶ but fuck!!!),
Alright time to pump stay at home stocks.,
Million death Speedrun: any% 

America is #1,
Omnicron these nuts in ur mouth bitch.,
It‚Äôs only a matter of time, dammit of course it‚Äôs in California where I live. Were fucked,
Didn‚Äôt they already state that this variant can be controlled with the vaccine?,
When did WSB become a cesspool of toxic Fox News consumers?,
Well, they wanted to blame China and Evergrande first, then Republicans for shutting down government, then the Nu variant but it sounded like New and useful idiots were confused and so they skipped to Xi, but that made it sound like they were blaming China again, so Omicron was just the next letter in the alphabet... but they didn't count on people seeing it's an anagram for MORONIC...  


Welcome to the MOASS.,
Thanks Crisis News Network!!!

Omicron spelt slightly different is MORONIC. Now... how does that make you feel?

I guess big pharm is still trying to recoup all their lost income they spent on opiate lawsuits. Won't be long before the next strain fattens up their bank accounts.,
All that Lets Go Brandon done pissed off that Dementia Patient so he Released the Omicron. Fucken A,
Cool flu 3.0....on to the next variant.,
never thought id be telling a bunch of retards they‚Äôre retards but the shot never promised you wouldn‚Äôt carry the virus, that‚Äôs like, the whole concept of herd immunity, alas.,
or Omnicron like Bidet called it. Not a typo btw,
Game over,

Use mirror!

You retard!,
Is that StockSim???,
You know you really fucked up when even turning the phone won't help üòÇüìâüìâüìâüíÄüíÄ,
Try 45 degrees,
This is actually a very original piece of comedy right here...,
üíÄüíÄüíÄüòÇüòÇ,
When you can figure out how to invert the pic to make it look positive, I can see why it's all downhill for you,
the secret is to read from right to left,
They're going up in Australia.,
üò≠,
That was Trippy!,
Try rotating it the other direction.,
It‚Äôs ok fellow tards we are in this together no matter which side you‚Äôre on,
Holy hell. At least you have NET. CRWD also had decent earnings so should pop tomorrow. I couldn't imagine holding those for this past month tho.,

No more stimulus, record high inflation, increasing interest rates, and new covid variant. What could go wrong?,
money printer is gonna go rrrb tomorrow,
What a shit show,
The NYSE guy actually seems like he fucks bitches,
This will age better than mine,
For real SPY went under 450, ya need to stop being so damn scared.,

Why didn't this happen when Delta hit?,
These would be more poignant (pungent) if you retards could make memes faster.  OP probably started making this meme on Saturday after news the market would dip.  Up Tuesday, and was like, "dddddddddrrrrrrrr, but gey bul r fuk".  Down today so now he's drinking the drool off his mom's sweatshirt he's wearing.,
I‚Äôll admit it, I‚Äôve been making that face all day.,
If Inflation is going to be high I don;t want to hold cash and I want to be invested.  If we get locked down I want to be invested in stocks that do well regardless of brick and mortar.  I don't see why I shouldn't be doing longterm buys.  Even if its gets worse by 2023 I won't regret the buying now.,
It‚Äôs doomsday bingo: Omicron, Hawkish FED, Lockdowns, Inflation, Shortages, and all that‚Äôs left is a giant earthquake to sink California into the ocean.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Man, do I feel justified getting downvoted for hell for calling out that meme earlier. Guess it isn't lame politics to just be based in reality after all.

Edit: Haha people in denial are mad üñï,
Puts on human civilization!,
Sold everything today! Holding cash until spy hits rock bottom.,
Imagine a common cold so deadly it could kill the economy and leave everyone alive to witness it.,
Noooo, Einstein!!,
u/tubbyteak,
Hahaha the fellow in the corner got me. Nice one.,
3x leverage spy etf every time jpow opens his mouth, congrats I just gave you free money,
üëÄ these 1 month charts for tech are looking juicy af!,

The original photo was of Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov, who was Stalins main NKVD executioner. Stalin had him killed and the photo of them together was altered. Not sure what this means tho

Edit: i dont speculate as to the intent of the tweets by one of the weathiest guy on earth...,
Splish splash, throwing some friends in the pool.,
You have to be honest, Twitter's new rules are dystopian af,
Some fuckker already made a Coin based on this ,I'm sure of it.,
Elon is more than likely on a hit-list, of being banned soon. Hopefully not, but the new rules and everything being written in place, is a major concern.,
Here we have the classic reddit downvote war where people can't like a joke because somebody they don't like made it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Whooosh 

Wtf is this?,
Vengeance will come in the form of a longer darker beard.,
Get woke go broke twitter.,
It‚Äôs the new Twitter CEO pushing Jack Doesey into the river to die.  New Twitter CEO said ‚Äúall white people are racist‚Äù, and that would include Jack,
Ez putts,
Jack got Noah'ed ü§£

^(... if you know, you know.),
Elon Musk is cringe,
HAHAHAHAHA WOW HAHAHA WHAT A MEEM XD XD HAHAHAHA.






 fuckin simps,
"IF I DEFEND ELON MUSK LIKE HES MY HUSBAND AND FATHER THEN I WILL BE JUST LIKE HIM"

Let the downvotes commence...,
I think its lost on half the people commenting that Elon changed the faces of Stalin to Parag Agrawal (New TWTR CEO) and Yezhov's face to Jack Dorsey. HAHA. I feel like this is so easy to see though. Fuck, our generation is stupid.,
That new twitter guy is even more woke them the previous one... ü§£,
Cringe lord Elon*,
This sub has just turned into an Elon Musk jerk off station. Wtf happened,
Gotta admit, Elon has a sense of humor.,
lord? Wtf you kissass, boot licking slaves call that Elon guy a lord? I swear you peasants know your place.,
I don‚Äôt get it. Why do so many people here like Elon Musk ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs so full of himself,
This is the kind of meme a mentally challenged boomer posts and wonders why their entire family and friends no longer talks to them,
Rich, nerdy, weirdos that were bullied in high school are now in positions of power.
What could go wrong?,
Tote legit bro,
Dorsey? The the guy that banned Trump? Pretty sure his day is coming. I live in town that has up Trump signs with Pence crossed out üòÇDorsey can go to Canada with the other Nazis. Fuck him.,
Elon is a shitstain. Its pretty good that Jack stepped down, but to equate Twitter with Stalin is the most cringey framing a Billionaire can put on this topic. Agitprop motherfucker needs to fuck off to Mars yesterday.,
That's very rich coming from someone who sold 6 billion in stocks in a week,
put your hands up for elon,
This is how the people from the ‚ÄúGeneration Jones‚Äù do photo editing. In this case, the original is Stalin and his boy Yezhov (equivalent to Hitler‚Äôs Himmler) and the second one is after Stalin got rid of Yezhov because he was overstepping his boundaries. Yezhov deserved it.,
Trolling for ban,
It means the great short seller purge has started‚Ä¶..,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
The cabal salute,
memes, the greatest power in the universe(internet),
Elon stirring the pot,
well he's gonna get twitter gulaged soon,
"Hi Jack. Bye Jack",
Haha so relatable! We should do everything he fucking says forever,
Musk and Dorsey probably teaming up on another business.

just hasnt been announced yet.,
But what does it mean and how does it reflect doge???,
i will call the louvre,
Trust me this confirms the stock split üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,
Why does Elon want to Bezos himself? Poor guy. Low self esteem about being bald?,
SPLASH!!!,
A lot of Twitter cocksuckers in the chat today ü•∏ü•∏ü•∏ü•∏,
There‚Äôs the dip,
I think since this tweet contains an image of a private individual it can be removed,
I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt mention pooping in this meme,
Little beardy guy's been shopped into the first photo, not out of the second photo. He's got a halo for chrissakes.

No idea what th fuck is going on.,
He is basically saying fuck you Jack, ya broke bitch I can have u OFFED üòú,
Kinda ironic considering he airbrushed the Tesla founders out of history,
DWAC..ers are licking their chops,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This was posted just before all my gains disappeared.  He was warning us and we were to blind to see it?

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),
Elon is cringe AF,
it's 2001 and we are posting Hitler memes

anyone know what kind of weed Elon is smoking today?,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN!!>>?,
White Silence is White Violence,
So‚Ä¶. Twitter call options‚Ä¶?,
If this pic doesn‚Äôt get you going I don‚Äôt know what will,
For those who don't get the joke 

https://www.history.com/news/josef-stalin-great-purge-photo-retouching,
Elon Musk is a 13-year-old.,
