People keep saying the invite code does not work.

Yes it does. I can make a new discord account right now and join with it. If you cant join its probably because you were banned, dont have an account, or have some browser related issue. The invite code is permanent and allows an unlimited number of people. It cannot and does not expire. It will never not work. https://i.imgur.com/jlg0IVn.png

If you have an invoice or proof of purchase that clearly describes the item and the number of units just black out the dollar amounts and send that. They want to see that you owned at least as many units as were on the shipment.

&#x200B;

As for future shipments...it will help to label them with the FNSKUs as well as the UPCs but honestly you can do everything right and they'll still lose units. Check your Received Inventory report, if the units were received and then subtracted later then the labelling was fine and Amazon probably misplaced them.,
They're just doing their due diligence before reimbursement. Send them what they've asked for - use your most recent invoice that is dated prior to the shipment.,
It sounds like you got unlucky with your test shipment.  I send *hundreds* of shipments per month to Amazon, and some small number always get lost, or improperly counted, etc.

Just send another shipment in like you did the first and it should go fine.  Just know Amazon loses a small percentage of *all* shipments, so be ready for it.

Also, you need to request Amazon "investigate" the shipment so you can get reimbursed for the lost units.  They will ask for proof you bought the product in the form of an invoice, and it sounds like you have that, which is perfect.  Here is a how-to guide with specific steps:

Dangerous Goods are classified into two volume categories. Aerosol and Flammable are separate categories and each have their individual volume limits. But yes, for the restock limits they still fall under standard-size.,

The correct page is here:

[FBA fees reimbursement policy: Weight and dimensions](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GGL7U4JFSDXUTQAJ)

You have to follow the instructions on this page exactly and it has to be a regular case.  This of course means you deal with the help desk so you'll probably need to submit multiple cases on the same issue until you get a person that actually reads it and processes it properly.,

Yep. And hopefully if sellers are smart, they'll continue telling aggregators to go fuck themselves when they receive an offer under 5x. 

Oh, and dont let those cockroaches sucker you into Earn out. Earn out benefits nobody but the buyer. Its even worse than financing. They pay you a small amount now and then they pay you the rest later, except "the rest" varies based on business performance. If they run your business into the ground? Sucks for you! If they decide to tack on huge management fees as expenses and reduce profit, therefore reducing performance and therefore reducing your earn out payments? Sucks for you!

They sell earn out as a benefit by telling you "Well we are very very good at this, so we will grow your business and you will get even more!" When they tell you that, make sure to let them know that if that was true, it would be an *even better* deal for them to just pay you 100% immediately. That way they're saving money by not having to send you those "impressive" earn out payments.

If they cant pay you immediately or set up *real* financing, they're screwing you or they cant afford you. If an agg offers you anything near 3.5x, treat it exactly like you treat people on craigslist who offer you $2,000 for your $10,000 car.,
Nobody should sell until pharmapacks SPAC plays out and gets a 20x valuation and use it as leverage . 200 million in sales and going to be valued and multi billions 
They have a lot of partnerships with major brands but literally have nothing proprietary or patented . If Amazon raises fees even a 1% it hurts their minimal margins a lot.,
$12bn funding in the space...

6x on average is still nothing. I’m waiting until the 10x+ rolls around which STILL is wildly low relative to the PE space.

Multiples will rise. Don’t be a sucker and sell now while they’re low.,
Do these aggregates only purchase businesses with brand ownership? We are 100% wholesale, do we have any value in the eyes of an Amazon business purchaser?,
Well, I'm seeing offers under 4x. So I don't think they're going up quite that high just yet.,
Standing, not sitting.,
No, they always been 3-4x thrashio though has been lowballing everyone at 2.5. If you get into retail and have your own warehouses, valuation then doubles to 8-10x.,
Is there any value to an FBA business that has been around for about eight years but is no longer selling much (moved into another sector)?,
I am seeing clients selling out quite a bit recently.
There is now a trend of new clients wanting their business to shoot up in sales in a few months rather than focusing on long term incremental gains.

It would seem this is a trend that is not slowing down.,

Every warehousing area near a port is expensive for a reason especially now . I’m in NY and we use our extra space for storage to other companies . Last month we got a lot of requests because all their normal NJ warehouses where filled to capacity and wouldn’t take any more loads .

Make sure if you decide to move to bumble fuck you factor in more expensive freight charges,
There's not many options within the US. Canada may be an option.,
We moved from SoCal to Vegas this year due to lack of affordable warehouse space. The city is blowing up here as a logistics hub. I think there are 8+ Amazon Fulfillment Centers and they are filling/selling warehouse space faster than they can build them. The deals are gone as of 6+ months ago, but still much cheaper than SoCal. The north and south of the city are all warehouses now.

Took about 3 months to move, rehire and get back up to full speed. Pallet Racking took months to procure because everyone is expanding and no one has any. FCL takes the same amount of time to receive as before (still goes through Long Beach unfortunately) but costs a few hundred more to ship inland. This is offset by all shipments to Amazon being local so far instead of all over the West Coast for the prior 18 months.

It was an expensive move but lower costs and taxes now (and in a couple years when we sell) will make it worth it. Should net us mid 6 figures by then.,
