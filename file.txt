Ive been taking a fuck load of notes on amazon fba. The information and things to watch out for never seem to end. 

What advice would u give someone about to dish out 500 on a source for the first time? I heard chinese scammers are pretty bad..,
I really want to start but im in a bad financial position that would not get better if I don't do something soon. Is there's any chance I could start earning profit through ecommerce business with less than 1k to start. I have to make it work....,
Thank you so much. That's what I'm thinking, reselling.
I'm really shy when it comes to ask for money lol 

Hope your business keep on growing. Much success to you and your partners,

I was thinking about starting a AmazonFBA pl business and was wondering if I need brand registry to sell on amazon?,
I different items need to sell and have been approved in multiple categories and each time it says congrats I go to add a listing bg and it says I need approval for example asin B095J64R7K it said I needed approval I requested it and then I go back to add it and it says I still need approval,
 Love the first product idea in this PDF!,
Can you link the file directly? I don't want emails :),
