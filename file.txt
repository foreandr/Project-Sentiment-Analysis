Dip buyers are morning people, apparently. Whereas I need 3 cups of coffee just to gather the energy to shower and dress myself.,
Just wanna say that if you're stressed because your portfolio is down thousands from merely holding, you're not alone. The market is fucked this week. We're in a major dip and even the alternatives have slipped. Omicron isn't going to end the world, war isn't going to break out, Christmas will come and go with little incidence as people will be used to them being shitty already. If your bull strategy is still the same, don't even open your app if you don't want to and your expenses are already paid.,
Its not the most wonderful time of the year,
Losing 5% a day every day for two weeks,
the fakest breakout in a year - this is def. a bull trap, loading up SPY 447 P,

Definitely doesn't look exactly like yesterday!,
Do you ever buy at the top, then wait fucking long for your stock to go back up and once you're finally back above your average cost, you think "Hey might as well let it get some profit since I waited so long." Only for it to go back down again and you end up having to wait a second cycle?,

Wsb ultra mega bearish. You know what that means,
Sharpen your pencils!!!,
One the luckiest/best trading weeks of my life. I've had puts the whole way down - no reason in particular, just caught the right side of it,
anyone speak to Jpowell's manager about this yet?,
ARKK down over 20% YTD. Yet people still care about Cathie Wood. Its like a fund holding pets.com, worldcom, and Enron….back in the day. You look like a genius on the way up but then crash and burn,
from the period November 1968 to December 2020 - a span of more than 50 years - the average length of a bull market was 1,764 days1 or approximately 58 months, while the average bear market lasted 349 days or 11.5 months.

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,

Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,

Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,

Yeah let me drink that and just let everyone know I post here with you fucks,
So many people making money off WSB, besides WSB.,
Ofcourse it’s an IPA,
Probably taste like paper hands because ppl who claim they are diamond hands are actually not diamond hands because why would they say it out loud? Ice cold ppl are the real diamond handed ppl and they don't utter a word because they are fucking savage. Paper hands scream they are diamond hands because they fear their inner fragile selves.,
For when you want to just hodl a beer.,
Two Hearted Ale from Bells, Kalamazoo Michigan,
They should make another one in honor of my portfolio, called bagholder, that's just a beer bottle of everclear. That way those of us that diamond hand past the green and deep into the red can cope,
I'm in Boston,, where do I get one?,
I don't drink but that's a cool bottle,
This is as bad as people selling merch to profit off you guys lmfaoo.,
I saw one a while ago called [DeepF*%#ingValue](https://untappd.com/b/hourglass-brewing-deepf-ingvalue/4203130),

Another brewery did it better. 16oz IPA. Way better,
Far out. We are everywhere!,

Hold my beer and yolo on stonks.,
inb4 one of these goes up someone's ass.,
I've never purchased a beer for "collector" purposes, but I feel like this one is perfecto for the display shelf. Now if I can find it,
So they pick a style of beer with basically the shortest shelf life to name "Diamond Hands" pretty stupid. A barrel aged stout or barleywine on the other hand would hold just fine for years.,
That's fuckin dope. Wish I thought of it.,
An IPA? Guh.,
Not sure what the obsession with IPAs is.,
Oh no it's an IPA,

My portfolio is running away from the market.,
My bad guys, had my first foray into stocks buying £5 of Costco on Friday. Isn't there supposed to be beginners luck?,
"It do go down" 😂🤣😂 Classic video!,
It was amazing how quickly that announcement just tanked everything.,
When you buy the dip but it just keeps dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
I went from +1500 USD to -3000 USD and a spam of margin calls from my broker.. Ahh shit, here we go again,
See y’all on the other side son! 😂,
r/gifsthatendtoosoon,
crashing hard i am running out of cash to buy the upcoming dips,
It's fucking CRM down 11 percent,
Look guys, this is just another chance to buy at massive discounts if you couldn't last Friday because you were too hung over.,
I've never seen past this point of this video. Anyone have the extended version?,
If Ive learned anything from our little adventures this year, it's that Im happier shorting bad stock than longing any good ones....,
I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative. 

What the fuck is going on?,
it go down,
Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,
When life gives you dip make chips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
this is how I found out my entire portfolio is red today,
AM:  Hey, I made back all the money I lost yesterday plus some more
PM:  And I lost it again plus some more.,
Lmao!!!!!  It do go down,
The Merle Haggard is the funniest bit,
Fucking pussies,
The funny thing is, in the original video they hit the wall and they never go down.,
Now this is a quality meme.,
This video is funny as fuck.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Apparently it do go down. Glad for once I wasn’t retarded and closed my calls for a 10% loss instead of holding. Then I bought puts.. Anyone else fuck up on puts today? Had to leave for work at 145pm ish, closed my 12/3 462P’s when SPY hit 458 🤡,
S&P closed lower than I panic sold 4 months ago. It's the little victories that carry me on,
Say it with me now diverse , diverse , diverse,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
thank god i didnt buy nothin today,
Not sure why you’d jump ship. Everything is on sale right now. Time to load up and stock the pantry,
Shit I looked at it earlier in the day and saw that it was fine. Didn't know it dropped again.

Apparently it was because of Omicron? How? How does the market drop like 3 times from 3 announcements of Omicron existing. Like we get it, there's a variant. Doesn't have to be breaking news every day lol,
This video gave me blue balls,
Does anyone know what happens after the vid cuts off? Always wondered what happened,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I’d lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man… when it lets me f*ck… Christ… it’s pretty glorious.,
u/savevideo,
It doooo go dowwwwwn!,
Fun fact - If you try and send this video to your friend on Facebook Messenger it literally won't let you. It's banned for some weird reason.,
Thanks to Omicron I am now holding thousands of dollars of a penny stock instead of not a penny stock and my dumb ass wants to average down.,
Sauce for the lolz?,
It's insane.  So far Omicron has killed 0 people worldwide.  You are statistically more likely to die because of ill fitting pyjamas.  Yet the markets flip out, governments overreact, and the only shares that gain are vaccine manufacturers who sign new deals to jab up an ever shrinking number of people.,
I’m just gonna ignore my portfolio until Mid January.

Lemme know if GME explodes before then though, so I can take some profit, thanks.,
It do go down.,
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
Did they live? The guys in the boat?,
hahahaha. That was so funny.,
Wow,
My portfolio today ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),
SPY 420 EOY!,
Whatever fits the agenda,
CNBC thought it was Powel not taking back what he said yesterday. The variant case has minor symptoms.,
Lol what happened next!!! I want episode two!! Did some one find their stuff down stream and uploaded it ? Omg so many questions I want answers!!!!,
Is there a full length version,
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?? 🥚,
So wtf happened? Did they go over?,
Hhahahaaahaha,
Yeaaaahhh my retirement account took a shit today.,
IT DO GO DOWN!,
Sold my spy calls at 9:00 AM and was pretty resentful, but I was up 50% and didn’t want greed to get the best of me. I was really relieved when I checked when I got of work at 3.,
I wanna know what the fuck happened to these 2 later on,
I/savevideo,
Clov,
Thats more or less me these past 3 months watchin g my portfolio dip.,
Luckily I am loaded on Chinese puts and sold my spy calls this morning.,
TrAnSiToRy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
I love adamant that guy is, "**it dont**",
This is so strange… I looked at the market today and this exact moment went through my head. I even sent a gif version of this in a discord as a comment… hadn’t thought about this in years,
This dip makes me wanna buy so much shares,
Fortunately there aren’t many numbers below 0.01 so I can’t lose much more,
For me the whole year with STUPID PENN I HATE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!,
It’s Black Friday sale all week!,
Like... Where was he gonna go?,
u/savevideobot,
Perfect summary,
My shop calls are bleedinnnnnggggg,

Puts galore today it was great,
Made like 3k on $MRNA puts lol,
#Evergrande,
Why the camera man sound like Dunkey,

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
It do go down,
Does it go down lol?,
I went from up 5% to down 8%. I love being retarded👍,
The fact that almost 90% of videos that were supposed to be good are always getting cut at the good part and posted on Reddit makes my blood boil. Why is this a thing?,
It do go down!,
🎵Workin’ on a fart inside of me🎵,
NOOOO VOO down 1.4%,
Look at me, I’m the clown now

Me after buying an options call on CCL.,
Looks like the riverways in New Orleans,
*”WaLkiiNn Ooohnnn THee FiiighTen Saaihde oo’ MeEeeL”*,
I just started investing recently so this sucks for me
I have no clue how to handle this,
Wheres the full vid for diamond hands POV,
Tesla stock until Elon musk tweeted about bankrupts and stock down .01 in seconds.,
It do go down,
I don't even mind losing all that money since it meant i got this gif.,
My portfolio is diversified so my losses aren’t so bad, but damn. I went from +16% to +9% in like 3 days, 7% gone with a sneeze,
This is proving to me that long holding Vix calls is a valid strategy,
Dude ant fishing.  Fake fishing right there.,
😆😆😆😆,
I’m dying! 🤣🤣🤣,
This dip is so much I feel like I'm being waterboarded. You wouldn't do that to me daddy Powell, would you? This isn't torture. It's just a little dip.,
Lmao,
I sleep,
That looks like a [low head dam](https://practical.engineering/blog/2019/3/16/drowning-machine-the-dangers-of-low-head-dams),
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,

The stone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
Thank god I’m cash heavy right now. I’m gonna be buying heavy while things are on sale,
F in the chat,
The kid way in the back like a caveman,
Clips that end too soon,
I get it: I’m not a retarded holder, it’s just the market has those days again,
You guys think omicron is scary?

Wait until ultracron. It's ultra.,
I thought 210 was a great black Friday sale. Whoops.,

Why is my whole portfolio in this movie...,
Any room on that raft JPOW?

Damn, now I’m just sad,
Oh fuck you gonna make me cry..,
U know the fate of this great gentleman?,
Sinking into Margin Call,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
It’s painfully painful because it’s true.,
I got a bad feeling CLOV is the next WISH.,
TSLA: “We’re getting a distress signal. I see a flare on the horizon!”,
Ah ha, you missed T.  Been holding, accumulating since $60 (when it was SBC).  Yah, that's right, bitches.,
God dammit Jpow Why,
Guys, is the age of apes over? Did the hedgies win?,
Has this whole sub given up on $SNDL? I really thought I'd see someone mention the absolute shitter of a week it's had.,
Speculative stocks are the first to deep red dildo drill during market downturn. Hopefully most of your portfolio is I'm solid blue chips like AAPL and MSFT,
Aha. Planned to watch Titanic with the wife this weekend. This is gold timing.,
