Dip buyers are morning people, apparently. Whereas I need 3 cups of coffee just to gather the energy to shower and dress myself.,
bulls don't hate me i've been permabull for a long time but

i'm buying puts,
Just wanna say that if you're stressed because your portfolio is down thousands from merely holding, you're not alone. The market is fucked this week. We're in a major dip and even the alternatives have slipped. Omicron isn't going to end the world, war isn't going to break out, Christmas will come and go with little incidence as people will be used to them being shitty already. If your bull strategy is still the same, don't even open your app if you don't want to and your expenses are already paid.,
the fakest breakout in a year - this is def. a bull trap, loading up SPY 447 P,
Quick swing for $400 today. Experience says to close the app and enjoy the win. Knowing me, I’ll fomo into another trade and go negative 😂,
Seems like a fake green day. Im out.,
Bad news today would be cataclysmic.,
Spy moving like a penny stock,
It’s been a brutal week, I wonder how many people got margin called,

I wonder what happened to all those AMC, CLOV and WISH (probably missed a few) bag holders who kept spamming this sub a few months ago.,
I just spoke to the market. Morale is not good,
Calls a few weeks out are the most stressful. Never know when to sell. Like shit could keep crashing and they’ll die or magically the market will moon and they will fly. No between,
Today’s the day I accept my shitty losses the last few weeks go cash until shits more normal. Can’t handle the stress of my account losing so much, feel in just making dumb plays non stop,
where were you when SPY died?,
when you're an institutional investor, you can do anything --

grab 'em by the tendie

they let you do it,
[removed],
I’m not getting the feeling that there will be any kind of initial pump.,
I dare you to open the market. I double dare you, mf!,

Definitely doesn't look exactly like yesterday!,
Do you ever buy at the top, then wait fucking long for your stock to go back up and once you're finally back above your average cost, you think "Hey might as well let it get some profit since I waited so long." Only for it to go back down again and you end up having to wait a second cycle?,

I’m incredibly jealous of how much coke this guy on CNBC had this morning,
Can you save bear comments until SPY is actually red? Y'all making me nervous for my puts by agreeing with me.,

Time to sell call spreads on ARK. They’re going to make a movie about her rise and fall. Who should they cast to play her? Jessica Chastain get my vote.,
Thing is, a lot of big tech is hanging out in like the low 20s PE range. I understand that’s high, but come on, who tf wouldn’t throw their entire god damn dick into something like AAPL if it had a PE of 19. 

Overleveraged MMs in high risk speculative positions capitulating as a result of a major correction might be a catalyst for a bear market as they sell off positions in blue chips to settle, but that shits gonna get bought up *fast*.

Welcome to the Kangaroo Market. If your timing is right you can make a fortune in either direction but chances are you just going to lose all your money.,
Better grab GRAB before it gets GRABBED. The GRABBENING IS HERE,
Today might actually hurt the most. 😳💩🥸🥴,
Poor here.
My money tied into calls that should still print and nothing to buy puts.  So it’s just a shitty  rollercoaster ride at this point.

Good luck.,

Wsb ultra mega bearish. You know what that means,
Sharpen your pencils!!!,
One the luckiest/best trading weeks of my life. I've had puts the whole way down - no reason in particular, just caught the right side of it,
anyone speak to Jpowell's manager about this yet?,
ARKK down over 20% YTD. Yet people still care about Cathie Wood. Its like a fund holding pets.com, worldcom, and Enron….back in the day. You look like a genius on the way up but then crash and burn,
from the period November 1968 to December 2020 - a span of more than 50 years - the average length of a bull market was 1,764 days1 or approximately 58 months, while the average bear market lasted 349 days or 11.5 months. Over this period, the average gain in a bull market was +180.04%, while the average loss in a bear market was -36.34%. 

Unless you’re 68 years old and losing all your retirement money, you’ll all be fine in the long run. Take it easy, buy stuff you believe in and hold it,
I’m about to end my whole career.,

It do go down,
well if we drop 5% with every new case of omicron then stock market should be worth $0 in 2 weeks,
Guess SPY is just gonna bounce up and down $2 all day,
Remember when Cathie Wood was being praised for making money in a euphoric bull run?And now she's being exposed for not knowing what the hell she's doing considering her indexes are down like 50% YTD,
It is 11am and SPY has gone up $6, then fell $4, and is now back up $4. Wtf the fuck kinda kangaroo shit is this?,

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,

Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,
Earnings are useless this week. Sorry bruh,

Not "most anticipated", but I have high hopes for JOAN on Dec 2nd,
Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,

So many people making money off WSB, besides WSB.,
Ofcourse it’s an IPA,
Probably taste like paper hands because ppl who claim they are diamond hands are actually not diamond hands because why would they say it out loud? Ice cold ppl are the real diamond handed ppl and they don't utter a word because they are fucking savage. Paper hands scream they are diamond hands because they fear their inner fragile selves.,
They should make another one in honor of my portfolio, called bagholder, that's just a beer bottle of everclear. That way those of us that diamond hand past the green and deep into the red can cope,

So they pick a style of beer with basically the shortest shelf life to name "Diamond Hands" pretty stupid. A barrel aged stout or barleywine on the other hand would hold just fine for years.,

Is this what they meant when they said to sell shovels and pick axes during gold rushes?,

New England IPAs are amazing.,
I personally would be proud to be drinking that beer and having everyone know I am a 💎🖐🦍!!! I cannot stress enough that this past year holding my GME has empowered me to try and make a difference in this F up financial system that only cares about the top 1%.,
Calls on Roblox?,
Gonna need a few of those 😂! I think people fell for that 30C super hard so I expect to move from 29-29.99 thru Friday! I personally would t recommend same week FOMO into these but what do I know! I just grabbed more shares 💎🙌🦍 NFA,
Ah, capitalism at its finest.,
Beer for retards*,

Why is my whole portfolio in this movie...,
Any room on that raft JPOW?

“no”,
Damn, now I’m just sad,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
Oh fuck you gonna make me cry..,
Aha. Planned to watch Titanic with the wife this weekend. This is gold timing.,
Where is wish,
U know the fate of this great gentleman?,
It’s painfully painful because it’s true.,
TSLA: “We’re getting a distress signal. I see a flare on the horizon!”,
I sold. Gotta realize them losses for 2021 taxes.,
I got a bad feeling CLOV is the next WISH.,
Sinking into Margin Call,
Ah ha, you missed T.  Been holding, accumulating since $60 (when it was SBC).  Yah, that's right, bitches.,
God dammit Jpow Why,
Me with AMC stock,
I let go $TSLA yolo at 330 pre split for a sweet 30% gains. Never again.,
Guys, is the age of apes over? Did the hedgies win?,
Has this whole sub given up on $SNDL? I really thought I'd see someone mention the absolute shitter of a week it's had.,
Wait, I wanted to see who Jack and Rose are!,
I didn't know /u/OSRSKarma can play the violin!,
What stock jumps off and hits the propeller? We need to know…,
ok but BBBY is good and back up 6 with another 6 tomorrow.,
Speculative stocks are the first to deep red dildo drill during market downturn. Hopefully most of your portfolio is I'm solid blue chips like AAPL and MSFT,

My portfolio is running away from the market.,
My bad guys, had my first foray into stocks buying £5 of Costco on Friday. Isn't there supposed to be beginners luck?,
"It do go down" 😂🤣😂 Classic video!,
It was amazing how quickly that announcement just tanked everything.,
When you buy the dip but it just keeps dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
I went from +1500 USD to -3000 USD and a spam of margin calls from my broker.. Ahh shit, here we go again,
See y’all on the other side son! 😂,
r/gifsthatendtoosoon,
crashing hard i am running out of cash to buy the upcoming dips,
It's fucking CRM down 11 percent,
Look guys, this is just another chance to buy at massive discounts if you couldn't last Friday because you were too hung over.,
I've never seen past this point of this video. Anyone have the extended version?,
If Ive learned anything from our little adventures this year, it's that Im happier shorting bad stock than longing any good ones....,
I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative. 

What the fuck is going on?,
it go down,
Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,
When life gives you dip make chips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
this is how I found out my entire portfolio is red today,
AM:  Hey, I made back all the money I lost yesterday plus some more
PM:  And I lost it again plus some more.,
Lmao!!!!!  It do go down,
The Merle Haggard is the funniest bit,
Fucking pussies,
The funny thing is, in the original video they hit the wall and they never go down.,
Now this is a quality meme.,
This video is funny as fuck.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Apparently it do go down. Glad for once I wasn’t retarded and closed my calls for a 10% loss instead of holding. Then I bought puts.. Anyone else fuck up on puts today? Had to leave for work at 145pm ish, closed my 12/3 462P’s when SPY hit 458 🤡,
S&P closed lower than I panic sold 4 months ago. It's the little victories that carry me on,
Say it with me now diverse , diverse , diverse,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
thank god i didnt buy nothin today,
Not sure why you’d jump ship. Everything is on sale right now. Time to load up and stock the pantry,
Shit I looked at it earlier in the day and saw that it was fine. Didn't know it dropped again.

Apparently it was because of Omicron? How? How does the market drop like 3 times from 3 announcements of Omicron existing. Like we get it, there's a variant. Doesn't have to be breaking news every day lol,
This video gave me blue balls,
Does anyone know what happens after the vid cuts off? Always wondered what happened,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I’d lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man… when it lets me f*ck… Christ… it’s pretty glorious.,
u/savevideo,
It doooo go dowwwwwn!,
Fun fact - If you try and send this video to your friend on Facebook Messenger it literally won't let you. It's banned for some weird reason.,
Thanks to Omicron I am now holding thousands of dollars of a penny stock instead of not a penny stock and my dumb ass wants to average down.,
Sauce for the lolz?,
It's insane.  So far Omicron has killed 0 people worldwide.  You are statistically more likely to die because of ill fitting pyjamas.  Yet the markets flip out, governments overreact, and the only shares that gain are vaccine manufacturers who sign new deals to jab up an ever shrinking number of people.,
I’m just gonna ignore my portfolio until Mid January.

Lemme know if GME explodes before then though, so I can take some profit, thanks.,
It do go down.,
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
Did they live? The guys in the boat?,
hahahaha. That was so funny.,
Wow,
My portfolio today ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),
SPY 420 EOY!,
Whatever fits the agenda,
CNBC thought it was Powel not taking back what he said yesterday. The variant case has minor symptoms.,
Lol what happened next!!! I want episode two!! Did some one find their stuff down stream and uploaded it ? Omg so many questions I want answers!!!!,
Is there a full length version,
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?? 🥚,
So wtf happened? Did they go over?,
Hhahahaaahaha,
Yeaaaahhh my retirement account took a shit today.,
IT DO GO DOWN!,
Sold my spy calls at 9:00 AM and was pretty resentful, but I was up 50% and didn’t want greed to get the best of me. I was really relieved when I checked when I got of work at 3.,
I wanna know what the fuck happened to these 2 later on,
I/savevideo,
Clov,
Thats more or less me these past 3 months watchin g my portfolio dip.,
Luckily I am loaded on Chinese puts and sold my spy calls this morning.,
TrAnSiToRy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
I love adamant that guy is, "**it dont**",
This is so strange… I looked at the market today and this exact moment went through my head. I even sent a gif version of this in a discord as a comment… hadn’t thought about this in years,
This dip makes me wanna buy so much shares,
For me the whole year with STUPID PENN I HATE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!,
It’s Black Friday sale all week!,
Like... Where was he gonna go?,
u/savevideobot,
Perfect summary,
My shop calls are bleedinnnnnggggg,

Puts galore today it was great,
Made like 3k on $MRNA puts lol,
#Evergrande,
Why the camera man sound like Dunkey,
what did i do to deserve this dip...,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
It do go down,
Does it go down lol?,
I went from up 5% to down 8%. I love being retarded👍,
The fact that almost 90% of videos that were supposed to be good are always getting cut at the good part and posted on Reddit makes my blood boil. Why is this a thing?,
It do go down!,
🎵Workin’ on a fart inside of me🎵,
NOOOO VOO down 1.4%,
Look at me, I’m the clown now

Me after buying an options call on CCL.,
Looks like the riverways in New Orleans,
*”WaLkiiNn Ooohnnn THee FiiighTen Saaihde oo’ MeEeeL”*,
I just started investing recently so this sucks for me
I have no clue how to handle this,
Wheres the full vid for diamond hands POV,
Tesla stock until Elon musk tweeted about bankrupts and stock down .01 in seconds.,
It do go down,
I don't even mind losing all that money since it meant i got this gif.,
My portfolio is diversified so my losses aren’t so bad, but damn. I went from +16% to +9% in like 3 days, 7% gone with a sneeze,
This is proving to me that long holding Vix calls is a valid strategy,
Dude ant fishing.  Fake fishing right there.,
😆😆😆😆,
I’m dying! 🤣🤣🤣,
This dip is so much I feel like I'm being waterboarded. You wouldn't do that to me daddy Powell, would you? This isn't torture. It's just a little dip.,
Lmao,
I sleep,
That looks like a [low head dam](https://practical.engineering/blog/2019/3/16/drowning-machine-the-dangers-of-low-head-dams),
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,
I need to see the rest of this video...,
Walkin on the fightin side of meeee,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
it do sucker  lol thats for funny stuff thank youes,
I love this video,
I say this all the time at work and no one understands the reference,
Shout out to Merle Haggard,
Dips keeeps dipping 😭🥺,
Parte 2?,
I lost so much money today....I just stopped looking at it,
The stone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
Thank god I’m cash heavy right now. I’m gonna be buying heavy while things are on sale,
F in the chat,
The kid way in the back like a caveman,
Clips that end too soon,
I get it: I’m not a retarded holder, it’s just the market has those days again,
You guys think omicron is scary?

Wait until ultracron. It's ultra.,
I thought 210 was a great black Friday sale. Whoops.,

Had a better average price originally, but had some huge things i had to deal with irl. Was able to clear that up and gave it my all to get my 10k shares back. No matter the share price at the time. So yes, im in it for the long run.,
I grabbed some also… not 10k worth but enough to make it sting if it goes tits up,
6k shares 20 $15 dec calls. Neutron presentation was epic.,
Good luck space cadet,
I'm working RKLB w 800 shares, 2 strike 14 CSP's, 8 Strike 18 CC's, 10 strike 15 calls. Love this company. I also added another 100 shares ASTR today.,
I’m not fucking selling!,

Vaccine effectiveness remains to be seen against the Omicron variant but even if it decreases there is still a possibility it could be comparable to the flu vaccine effectiveness of 40-60%.

So buy 2023 puts and shut your phone off, let’s see what you’re really made of.,
This doesn't look like anything, to me.,
So you're saying pets.com is a safe investment then,
Can't you do this with pretty much any rally as long as you pick the right time frame?,
But SPY still hasnt hit 500?,
Now compare the current pe, and revenues of the current companies vs those “companies”,
Fuck you this chart has gotten me before. 

My money will ride and die in the fucking market.,
Don't spoil the ending!,
So buy Amazon?,
Not to mention panic sellers can tank the market in 3 seconds on Robinhood instead of putting on your reading glasses and sausage fingering 1800 E-Trade into your cordless phone bought with xom dividends.,
That’s not how history works, everyone knows it doesn’t repeat itself.,
Most likely if the government/Fed does it correctly, a little less than halfway down the leg they can turn a Bear run into a bull… Turn the bearish crab into a bullish bat. The current climate situsiom is quite obvious what is going on but not being said in MSM. 

The banks/institutions are being a little bitch, throwing a tantrum showing the Fed fine we will let the market crash if you dont lower our margin interest rate. A few weeks ago inflation increased their borrowing rate. Currently in a standoff,
Gheeeeyyyy ber,
What a stupid, meaningless post.,
Sounds like a good time to Michael Burry style short,
I can't see shit. That means buy right?,
It’s okay inflation is transitory ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Ok bubble boi 😏🌈🐻,
People act like a bear run is worse than a bull run, I’m salivating. 😭,
apples to oranges,
same scale and all huh,
They didn't have Powell,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Typical 🏳️‍🌈🐻, only wants to talk about historical data when it is cherrypicked in their favour,
I have to wait two more years before I can buy again?,
🏳️‍🌈 THANK YOU u/PS77X,  V E R Y  G A Y! 🏳️‍🌈,
Spoiler alert!,
Anyone can draw those stupid lines the way they want, honestly this technical bs is always 50/50 just like the odds of your survivability. So just chill the fuck out it ain’t crashing like that. 30/40 percent quick correction is what we all need.,
🌈🐻,
This is like when ESPN says this player has the highest QBR when his team is down 8 points with 43 mins left in the game and the defense has an average of 2 turnovers per game when their offense scores 16 or less points and the QB has been in the league 21 games or less and the opposing QB has been in the league 36 games or more. 

Just total nonsense. If you dig for numbers you can make them look like they work whichever way you want,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
holt shit does that show the dip at 2026...... wow wtf were fucked.,
Oh. My. God.,
Could go a hell of a lot higher,
Guess the right side of this triangle graph does angle downwards after all…,
Thanks for showing us the chart Dr. Burry,
Calls on Lehman!,
Imagine robinhood deleting the sell button on everything,
When everybody knows the market is crashing. It's time to buy Calls.,
The PE ratio right now for the S&P is lower than it was during the height of the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble burst or during any time during that euphoria,
Nothing to see Here!!!! Move along, no news here.. Stonks only go up.....,
got it, buy moar calls,
This is stupid and meaningless.,
Op can you fucking not 😒,
2024 daddy will be back to save us,
stock only go up? this shows stock go down???,
so the s&p is going to drop 90%? lol...,
The wheel keeps on turning!,
Good luck my friends,
So it went up then down?,
Let’s gooooo,
That red color is scary,
Creepy,
So I shouldn’t go balls deep into SPY LEAPS yet?,
This is fine.,
I’m guessing the overlap for this run is adjusted for 1999-2000 era inflation?,
This is fucking retarded,
Abandon the ship,
So in order for history to not repeat itself, just keep buying,
*pop*,
Anyone wanna take a $500 bet that come early 2022 SPY will look nothing like this and not teat that trendline? Because im serious game,
If by the start of 2022 spy has continued to rise will you leave WSB and never post your crayon correlations again?,
but i thought markets are strong during inflation since everyone puts their money in there?,
[removed],
Buy more gme? Ok got it,
Wow a correlation

How exciting ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This. Is. Freaky.,
this scares me,
Yes because the spy and the dotcom had the same companies gad,
that looks scary.,
The potato quality of the image is very distressing.. almost as distressing as the image itself!,
What's actually in the bubble when it bursts anyway? I hope it isn't what I think it is.,
I guess $TSLA will become the next $CSCO then, LOL . . .,
You better shut up,
La La La La La can’t hear youuuuuuuu,
ahh,now I understand the smoke coming out of my crystal ball. Thanks mate.,
buy some put if you are really convinced,
I dont understand these charts, elliot waves, 50 day moving averages, candlesticks, etc. I did my research, created a shopping list with buy points. If shit goes on sale I buy C's or equity. If shit is fairly valued I write C's on equity. Simple Ape approach to investing.,
I’m already in the negatives i can’t handle much more losses.,
Sir fudington of gay bear island in the flesh i see,
Shooooooorttt!!!,
This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I can cut and past and scale any bull runs together,
History doesn’t repeat itself, We do!,
Where do you think the money will go outside of assets? 

All the billionaires are going to decide they have enough money and just want to hold depreciating cash now?

Or maybe pixelated jpegs are undervalued at $10m…

How do people not get this. For a crash to happen the money has to go somewhere,
BTW what happened that caused the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble to burst?,
4 year bear market has my dongger fucking moist,
History will repeat?!?,
EveRyThiNG iS finE,
Fear warmongering Pog,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Short it bitch. I dare you.,
Inflation means everything gets more numbers in its price tag, including stonks. Case closed.,
So switch to call credits from put credits. Thanks dad.,
I see no correlation. I’m also not gonna look at it,
I've seen this one, SPY 220p 4/20 

https://www.macrotrends.net/2488/sp500-10-year-daily-chart

Go ahead and sell, I'm buying.,
Internet is part of us now unlike 20 years ago. Covid proved this to be true.  It’s the new heroin,
This is the dumbest shit I've seen in a while.,
Now do 1929. Now do 1929.,
Charts literally mean nothing,
Fuck,
Yeah but its not a bubble this time. 🤡,
I laugh when i see posts that target a specific stock.

They literally create panic sellers and are a part of how the stock move. 

Bet OP has puts already down.,
I will PUT that in my folder,
Proof of puts or shut the fuck up.,
457c expiring Friday. Free money or free brokedom.,
You cannot time the market, period.,
Is it the same percentage increase?,
One more deeper,
Running of the Bulls and riding Bears down yield satisfaction, but Kangaroos are the real killjoys.,
As a dark mode user, I literally do not see a dot.com bubble.,
So you're shorting spy? Lets see it!,
Ok guys OP has predicted the future. That means the next 6 years of market movement is right in-front of us in this post. Make sure you buy that bottom in 2026! /s,
Bruh ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
SELL EVERYTHING!!! (I want to buy it with a discount),
That would suit me quite well actually. So it ain't happening,
We are in a bubble, being inflated by the Feds printer, and that thing isnt even close to out of ink,
It is a ticker. it doesn't tell the future. it is a ticker.,
Got it, just sold more puts, wish me luck,
It's still going to go up,
Can you compare the dotcom prices to today’s prices though? If dotcom era people held on until today I’m sure they’d be doing fine. Not like dotcom era was ATH.,
This can't be real,
You do realize this means nothing OP, right?,
ok now overlap it with my bloody asshole,
Damnit, of course this is one of the pictures that doesn't load!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) they say history doesn’t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme,
But what’s it mean tho?!,
Congrats on your phenomenal analysis,
Not this time! I’m tired of these pesky wrinkles To the mooooon,
Squiggly lines from different era of technology look like squiggly lines today.

I think you ate one too many crayons.,
Gonna pretend I didn’t see that,
This chart is spooky for people who don't know how puts work.,
This is some gay bear propaganda. Stocks only go up.,
But what if this time it's different?,
STFU,
Same time and y axis scales? Or tweaked to look nice and convenient,
I still have my original share certificate for Nortel. Literally was my college fund.,
So what we're saying is past results are indicative lf future trends?,
I’m really good at buying the top,
Stonks only go up. You’re just a silly boomer.,
Charts are for 🌈 🐻,
Thinking this is relevant is ridiculous,
Weren’t people saying housing prices will collapse for the last 100 years???,
yea only thing was theres no way inflation was as bad then as it is now,
So, I have to hold these european airlines for 8 more years?,
so your telling me we got 4 years to go of this down stuff.  i was told stocks only go up.  this can't be right.,
Except one of them has federal funding,
It could just as easily keep going up and crash down to current price... If thst happens in 12 months everyone will say 'I told you so' whilst buying right now could still double your money 🤷‍♂️,
Do you live in a cave and trade by candle light?,
Ahhh. The overlap of charts from the past part of market cycle. 

This brings me back to like 2006/7. 

It was all the rage to overlap charts.,
living in the past I see,
The fuck is this garbage?,
If you take these two charts, invert and layer on top of the original you’re going to see a diamond so I think we’re good until forever,
And if you play it backwards it is an exact replica of the 2002 McDonald’s dollar menu,
👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀,
Now do SPY / m2,
No one is curious, please delete.,
both charts need to be log scale for it to mean anything,
Glad to see I am not the only one who hears the music stopping. Today's action was mind boggling. I was in the green, sold my oil calls from yesterday(was feeling like a genius). Dumped all my winnings into AMD(I finally got in, portfolio complete..hooray). Job done for the day, watched some Narcos, took a nap and I woke up to my RBLX and MTTR just getting crushed. The stock market sucks.,
Any idiot could do this with any time period.,
Imagine scaling two images together to fit each other’s size,
Popped in March bruh,

This is true loss porn.,
Pretty much every position you own is from WSB….  Outcome checks out haha,
PayPal has been a bitch this year,
You’re an investor now,
I get the losses of others are supposed to make me feel better but nah… I want all of us to make some money. Days like today just suck all the way around, but just learn from it and try to be prepared if this happens again,
You really took “stocks only go up” literally,
Man. How do I become like you and afford that many shares . What is your job,
How were you able to pick all 20 losers. I need to inverse your next picks,
Duuuude, you going to be so rich when you break even!,
This is a menu of retardedness,
You Sir, Are a true Retard. RIP,
Rip friend.,
I hope that you hold and that they all go back up in time bud
 Merry Christmas 🎅 and keep your head up,
I would advertise these for sale at original cost on Craigslist.  There's gotta be people out there that made big bank and need offsets for tax purposes.,
Is this Cathie?,
This is like a old school hustler magazine of loss porn where you have to turn the pages. 

And now I put It back under my bed for next time,
My bitch, Cathie you?,
The one im happy about is HOOD. Carry on sir.,
Oooooof, you still holding Baba or you out?,
Clov fam!,
Most of these will fully recover, I would only be worried about CLOV tbh,
Does your wife’s boyfriend know about this?,
F,
F


Not even one green!,
Get the fuck off wsb,
Ouch. I gained like .05% today somehow instead of losing all of it lol.,
Good morning thank yoh,
Lmfao rip,
I feel much better, thank you,
Loss bukkake,
What's your next move? Someone as consistently bad as you is worth a fortune,
Wow you are really good at picking losers. All I gotta do is inverse you and I would be rich,
Is this realized or unrealized?,
How can you be so diversified and still be redder than the  RedSea,
Thanks i was feeling depressed today,
Should I buy INTC, AMD or NVDA?

Yeap, INTC it is...,
Wtf do you just buy ANYTHING WSB mentions?,
Bro your stocks aren’t even that bad buy when and why then are you buying them,
How did you lose money on TSLA?!? Dont tell me you tried to short,
Mother of all retards!!! That is the most restarted portfolio i have ever seen. god bless you sir!,
This does put a smile to my face 😏,
wow. this is bad,
RIVN is only down less than 3%....gotta hold that one longer to lock in better losses,
The horror... Sorry. That's a lot of P&P wasted.

Heck, they banned a meme I posted about Moderna getting sideswiped by patent. That should tell you something about WSB ;) Good to goof, not necessarily "sound investment advice".,
Ahh when I feel bad about losing $2000 I just come here and it helps me feel less retarded.,
Im not that much off either bruf,
🐐,
What the actual fuck,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)hey op since you don’t like money how about you buy my wife a nice Christmas present ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
you are a smooth brain ape on steroids. give him a box of crayons full box that is![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy),
Why no wish, clne or uwmc? This list isn't complete,
$10,000 in cash could heal my wounds way more then watching folk farm losses for tax write offs tbh. I'm on disability, y'all fucking kill me with this shit.,
U should Play Roulette. All in red,
the irony go read his only comment lol,
At least show us the gain positions as well,
Thanks for the sacrifice,
You need to call the 800 number and ask them to manage the rest.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
It's so fucking sad, I'm even laughing,
eh... you've got like $900k left how is that true loss porn.  and down \~$350k?  $1.25 million to $900k is like a 25% oscillation and they're shares not option burnouts.  so when market recovers you'll like be made whole.  this is not classic WSB loss porn.  this is someone just showing off volatility in their portfolio.,
I kind of does help I always feel that I alone am buy the top. Almost every stock Iv bought this year has come back to my average. Im still Bullish on All but damn does it suck to think back when I saw people mention selling I was like "STUPID FUCK" then turns out I am the FUCK.,
That's a lot of damage.,
That baba hurt me right in the kokoro,
intc is really the gem in there,
How did you lose so hard just trading stocks Jesus.,
Just buy MSFT stock next time,
Oof. That's brutal.,
You gotten a call from our trade desk saying you need to sel your shit?,
I'm absolutely reeling for you brother, that's painful.,
WOW.,
this is why they say just put it in spy,
At least they aren't permanent losses like if you went all in on options.,
ooof. I think you'll be ok on INTC in a few years.,
After buying WISH at $13, I've learned to not touch anything WSB talks about. 


After GME became publicized, big banks use Reddit to manipulate all the stocks on here.,
Wow I didnt know you can be so safely diversified and still lose on everything,
I have no empathy for that clov loss.,
Lmfao this ain’t yours,
If by “heal your wounds” you meant made me cum then yes…it helps,

Jan 2022
Living in the dumpster behind wendys,
I literally put 10k in today, after being out for years. Instant 1k loss lol, I was on the phone begging to get my bank account linked hahaha

It said 2-3 days and the transfer happened in 1 day and I was excited. 

RIP
They knew,
So when can I buy the high?,
Take my picture down,
I went through all of those stages this morning lol,
Tax loss harvesting at its finest,
This post and these comments made me laugh so FUCKING hard that i legit died , this is a ghost typing,
This is basically me,
I bought puts at the low, so I feel like this still applies to me,
Thrust fist directly into ass and keep pumping. Got it.,
Time is a flat circle.,
Turn that clown upside down.,
Buy high, sell low - Warren Buffett,
In conclusion. Stock market sucks.,
I'm holding tight.  Only downside is I don't have anything left to double down on this dip.  Might sell a few slow movers that are up.  I expect a decent rebound.  December could easily be a 20% month.,
I tax loss harvested some dumb buys, but still up overall and buying this dip even if it goes further into Christmas. Lets go!,
Stocks only go up, sometimes it’s positive up sometimes it’s negative up,
It will be different this time, it’s not going back up 🤡,
I’m done with clowns. Win or lose just own it,
so we should be buying now the blood is on the street.,
All about the long term,
maybe if your memes didn't suck they wouldn't get deleted,
I think this is just the beginning of the dip. I'm holding out to go all in. The perfect (ish) time to convert all those pension funds to an IRA (better make it Roth!) is coming!,
Haha! The joke is on you. I'm skipping the last step.,
Repeat 3x while looking at a mirror during a full moon.

"Buy high, sell low",
option expires. you don't sell retard.,
😂😂😂,
Idk I just buy puts,
that hurts many of my friends here,
Dank.,
Vaccine effectiveness remains to be seen against the Omicron variant but even if it decreases there is still a possibility it could be comparable to the flu vaccine effectiveness of 40-60%. If comorbidity is the same or less than Delta I don’t see why markets would not bounce back from a large over reaction. BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!,
Bought amc at 16$ for 150$ in match.

Then next next 2 or 3 days bought amc dip again at 8$ for 150$.

Still waiting AMC to take off.,
Guys Buy $TAKOF it’s going to explode today and tomorrow, please don’t miss it. I came here just to warn you. Get in 0.65$ OTC market it’s going to 1.5$ end of December 🚀🚀🚀🤑🤑🤑🤑,
Well at least I'm not the only retard.,

You sold high? What’s wrong with you?,
Good for u bro. Now take some of that out and buy urself something nice before ur next yolo lol.,
I’ve had AMD for years and it’s been a wild ride. I liquidated my original investment worth a couple times over and still have 3x riding,
Congratulations that’s awesome…and fuck you,
“And what happened, then? Well, in r/wallstreetbets they say – that u/CaspeanSea 's smooth brain grew three wrinkles that day. And then – the true meaning of being retarded came through, and u/CaspeanSea found the account of 5 baggers, plus two!”,
May your wifes boyfriend buy the car he has always wanted.,
nice, I remember doing covered calls with AMD when it was around 80 dollars and it just got assigned sometime in summer at around 100 and I thought "meh it won't keep going up" and boy am I a fucking moron.,
https://i.imgur.com/eTM17eJ.jpg  I see your 700% and raise you my 947%!,
Congratulations, now please go yolo in tsm like me!,
Perfect timing I just bought it yesterday,
Today I lost 66,000 on my main ccount. glad to see you took the opposite side of my bet. proper job,
watch it go up 7000% after you sell all,
I jumped in at the low 70s and dipped at the high 80s. I thought I did pretty well and then looked at it a few weeks later and it was sitting in the 100s haha. 

Oh well, be glad for the money you made. Not mad at the money you didn't.,
Smart, I will take it from here(Got in at $158). I am ok though I am a professional bagHolder, it's what I do.,
Can u get the mods to give u an AMD BULL flair or something?,
Bruh god damn,
Stay blessed king,
I had these same calls, doubled my account since September. Congrats man,
Alright guys, buy in, AMD to $5T in 3 years.,
I think some people meant to buy and AMD and accidentally bought AMC,
Can't be mad about that! We can... but you can't. Congrats retard.,
Well done sir,
Now Short it and really double dip  😍😍,
Any not financial advice for chosing options?,
One of my NCOs bought 10000 shares of AMD when it was 2 a share back in January 2018. He is still holding,
Exercise them fgt,
Keep the $280 call,
Congratulations bro, let me know if you want to start a small cap garage investment firm.,
Nice, had the $90 calls, got weak hands and sold at $50. Still have my shares though.,
U sold early bro,
*how to turn thousands into many thousands*,
Desktop metals has been getting shorted hard. Could be a good one to take for a run,
*slow clap* (by the IRS),
Good shit my man. Hookers and blow time?,
What kind of car are you going to get?,
Now go Intel.,
Cramer got you scared?,
sells 3 weeks before the tax cutoff... smooth move Ex-Lax.,
Nice. Now if you want 10,000x yolo gme shares :D,
$TSM set up for the next yolo. Consolidation all year ready for the breakout m.,
Only 700%? I’m over 1500%,
[deleted],
Well played dude, congrats!!,
How much of that will be going to taxes?,
🗞️ 🖐️biotch,
PoW coming soon,
Congrats bruv,
Yeah it's been a crazy run. Especially the recent rally. Let's see what next year brings.,
Also holding on and. Congratulations and fuck you,
[deleted],
well deserved my friend some real motivation,
How dare you post something green that isn't a robinhood loss!,
Good for you man, all mine have expired worthless. Please don’t tell the wife’s boyfriend I lost all his money.,
I touch myself,
Congratulatory and obligatory fuck you :),
Smart man. Congrats on that. Im pissed at myself for selling my shares at 45bucks. Big mistake.,
If  it is good enough to screen shot, it is good enough to sell.

&#x200B;

Congratulations,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Wtf? Take profit?

Can someone ELI5 the concept of taking profit?,
Should I keep my $135c 2023? The market is starting to worry me, I’m up a lot though.,
One should never argue with profit! Congratulations Sir,
When did you initiate the position and did you average down?,
That's some nice juicy profit you got  there. Christmas is coming up, better start shopping for your wife's BF.,
Consider yourself realized you fucker! Cheers,
What a good timing. Good job.,
amazing when did you originally buy the calls?,
Wow whateverrr,
Sold before the Xilinex deal?,
I wonder how many times I shorted all y'all,
Congratulations and fuck you.,
How much of a tax bill does this run you? Just curious.,
Funny thing is $AMD is still considered "fair" value while pretty much every other tech giant is "overvalued". It's likely one of the few positions to hold post the impending tech bubble pop.,
Only 700%? Slacker...

https://i.imgur.com/tnIDNjD.png,
can anyone explain the pic? what is the right axis? price? or what? because the price is not at 43 range currently so what am I missing?,
Sorry for the stupid question, but the contracts aren’t expired? They are from jan 21 no? 
Can someone explain please?,
What's the broker?,
Fuck you is all i can say here. Laters.,
Tradestation software?,
I remember getting margin called when it was round 73 it was obvious to cheap for people to buy then,
That was not very retard of you!!,
Congratulations!  Very nice job 👍,
Man what you doing ….. you’re suppose to buy high sell low,
Which platform your using, please ?,
All those green numbers it looks so beautiful,
Had an average of $7.46 per share sold awhile back for $56-ish .. made a pretty big profit,
Next up, Nokia?,
And here I am so proud of all the $$ I lost on AMD. My loss, your gain.,
Insane. Congratulations!,
Waiting till the merger goes through,
I’ll wait till after the omicron fears pass,
Been holding all my shares since $10. With 1,400% gains I'm still holding. No point cashing out if I don't need the cash.,
Congrats and fuck you,
Coward,
This is awesome to see. Thanks for sharing OP. I’m sure it’s a bittersweet relief. More sweet than bitter 💎🙌🏼,
This is my BB dream,
This autistic savant has accumulated many bananas. Wow.,
There’s no saying goodbye to Amd. You only add to the dips,
Guys Buy $TAKOF it’s going to explode today and tomorrow, please don’t miss it. I came here just to warn you. Get in 0.65$ OTC market it’s going to 1.5$ end of December 🚀🚀🚀🤑🤑🤑🤑,
You might be able to afford a graphics card now ! Irony..,
Should I hold my 2023 leaps 70 calls,
Someone actually uses Tradestation?,
Bravo,
Sick!,
Wow, congrats. Hoping I have the same experience with my chinese stocks in 2023 and 2024.,
Or you wait January 1st to see if you save 250k on taxes next year.,
Ive been sitting on mine since it was $5/share. It is too bad I didn't buy wayyy more. =/,
OP send $800 bucks for my rent. Thanks.,
total newb, can someone explain what's going on here? I think I understand the mechanics of a long call – you buy the option to buy at a set price. But I'm not understanding the figures in the 'Position' column (the amount of options bought at that $?) and how it corresponds to the total cost.

Does this basically mean /u/CaspeanSea was buying calls for December in January?,
Jimmy Chill pumped-up $AMD before the recent rally, but that cunt is hit-and-miss so I didn’t YOLO. Bought $WISH instead….

Tell me everything is going to be alright…. Lie to me….,

No more stimulus, record high inflation, increasing interest rates, and new covid variant. What could go wrong?,
I must be sick...I'm way more interested in what Omicron is gonna do to markets rather than people. Elon tweets are a buy signal, whenever Fauci gets trotted out again...super buy signal.,
money printer is gonna go rrrb tomorrow,
For real SPY went under 450, ya need to stop being so damn scared.,
What a shit show,
This will age better than mine,
If Inflation is going to be high I don;t want to hold cash and I want to be invested.  If we get locked down I want to be invested in stocks that do well regardless of brick and mortar.  I don't see why I shouldn't be doing longterm buys.  Even if its gets worse by 2023 I won't regret the buying now.,
The NYSE guy actually seems like he fucks bitches,
It’s doomsday bingo: Omicron, Hawkish FED, Lockdowns, Inflation, Shortages, and all that’s left is a giant earthquake to sink California into the ocean.,
Why didn't this happen when Delta hit?,
These would be more poignant (pungent) if you retards could make memes faster.  OP probably started making this meme on Saturday after news the market would dip.  Up Tuesday, and was like, "dddddddddrrrrrrrr, but gey bul r fuk".  Down today so now he's drinking the drool off his mom's sweatshirt he's wearing.,
I’ll admit it, I’ve been making that face all day.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Puts on human civilization!,
Hahaha the fellow in the corner got me. Nice one.,
Actually less deadly than the flu for once,
I had a character live 2 months in project Zomboid. I'm ready for the collapse.,
u/tubbyteak,
Watch out for Jeromicron,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Man, do I feel justified getting downvoted for hell for calling out that meme earlier. Guess it isn't lame politics to just be based in reality after all.

Edit: Haha people in denial are mad 🖕,
Imagine a common cold so deadly it could kill the economy and leave everyone alive to witness it.,
Sold everything today! Holding cash until spy hits rock bottom.,
Noooo, Einstein!!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Loool,
Lol this is actually gonna happen. Owoshsohaos,
I made 30% in DWAC today.,
Futures are green. I am still hopeful for tomorrow.,
Buy toilet paper!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
What happen to nobody cares???,
I know where this variant came from… an alien told me….  He said “ I am Lrrr, ruler of the Planet Omicron Persei 8! “. I think we might be in trouble …,
so the guy has only two shots..probably moderna..and has a cold with omicron..i see this as a good sign. I’m waiting for the panic to perist for a few weeks then start buying in jan,
Just gotta replace the second picture with the chart for high yields bonds $HYG and you got yourself a mirror!,
Vaccine effectiveness remains to be seen against the Omicron variant but even if it decreases there is still a possibility it could be comparable to the flu vaccine effectiveness of 40-60%. If comorbidity is the same or less than Delta I don’t see why markets would not bounce back from a large over reaction. BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!,
Dat Heihachi cosplay tho,
wait but doesnt the market go up whenever they show that guy,
👀 these 1 month charts for tech are looking juicy af!,
3x leverage spy etf every time jpow opens his mouth, congrats I just gave you free money,
That guy on the bottom right looks like the scientist from Half-Life lol.,
How the hell do you pronounce this variant? Is it O-Micron or Omi-Cron?,
Chew on some dry like seamen,

Look at it from a mirror,
Try 90 degrees,
It's not your phone you must turn around, it's your head,
Have you tried reinstalling?  This is a known issue.,
How did you make it not red?,
It’s a glitch, just give me your password and I’ll fix it for you,
Plz SOFI do something 😭,
Have you tried the reverse card?,

Cursed market images,
Whoa,
clever turning the colors off,
Sir set it to wumbo,
SoFi looks like it’s rebounding bro,
They lied to us.,
topsy - torvy,
It was worth a try,
I see what you did there,
You need to look at it sideways..,
Lul,
Yeah. Tough day,
Try photoshopping it and drawing your own upwards movement, that should work.,
😂😂😂🤪,
It's a conspiracy...,
Look from right to left.,
And they say it ain't a rigged game,
Try putting it in rice,
Just delete the app. Worked for me.,
sad long-sofi vibes,
You sir can take my down vote.,
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?,
what about if you go to Australia?,
Use mirror!

You retard!,
Is that StockSim???,
You know you really fucked up when even turning the phone won't help 😂📉📉📉💀💀,
Try 45 degrees,
This is actually a very original piece of comedy right here...,
💀💀💀😂😂,
When you can figure out how to invert the pic to make it look positive, I can see why it's all downhill for you,
the secret is to read from right to left,
They're going up in Australia.,
😭,
That was Trippy!,
Try rotating it the other direction.,
It’s ok fellow tards we are in this together no matter which side you’re on,
Really good picks though,
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,
Lol 😆 what if you look at it in a mirror?,
thanks for reminding me to buy sofi!,
Hey i can fix it for you. Give me your password.,
Sofi lol I feel u,
Try flapping it instead of flopping it.,
False advertising, I was told turning the monitor upside down would give me gains, someone is getting sued.,
put it in water,
In Arabish you are now rich,
Holy shit this made me squirt coffee from my nose,
Australians are fucked too!,
Saul?,
Have to mirror, not flip.  Also change hue settings.,
In Arabic charts you're winning big,
Definitely had me in the first half. Saw SOFI even though it was upside down and literally thought “wait a fuckin min….oh”

It’s been a long week 😅,
Someone skipped algebra 😂,
I lost this yesterday, and it didn’t phase me at all. It will be up today.,
Holy hell. At least you have NET. CRWD also had decent earnings so should pop tomorrow. I couldn't imagine holding those for this past month tho.,

Either millionaire or thousanaire by year’s end. Taking bets right now,
Wow congrats . I did something similar on a smaller scale. I turned $500 into $10k then I lost it. It's not always a happy ending . Good shit though,
Ill see you at wendys in a couple months as your addiction has begun,
I remember some guy went from like 600 bucks to 800k on amd... And then lost it all. God bless.,
Lmao are u using an actual pic of yourself as profile pic?

Edit: seems like he removed it now,
I know how to turn 137k into 2k in 10 minutes. Anyway, congrats you retarded genius.,
Wow bro that’s fucking insane. SPY always does the opposite of what I do. Literally the moment I buy calls, it drops $10, the moment I buy puts, it jumps $10. I must have lost like…15k because of SPY in September. I just don’t trade it now.,
if you think about it you're always a 3 win streak away from 6 figs its insane,
Go for $1m,
Check my previous post to see the 2K to 43K

[First Post of 2K to 43K gains ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r5xnmc/turned_2k_into_43k_in_a_week/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf),
Imagine buying 1000 455p contracts at .01 today and selling at close.,
analfarmer3?,
Man I gotta learn how to trade options.,
Happy for you if you make it and make $1t.
But those call options are probably worth half of it at market close.,
What’s ur next move?,
18k to 42k to 18k to 20k, has been my month so far. I just like spinning the wheel,
That would knock out one quarter of my student loans..I wish I could get that lucky and not just lose it all.,
VERY NICEEE!!! 🏳️‍🌈🐻,
Want to finance my gambling addiction?,
Holy shit, nice job and fuck you.,
Your first post fired me up so I bought spy puts at open. Still holding up 150%. Did you sell?,
Cash out don’t get greedy. You’ll lose it all (speaking from experience),
Well if you take gains now you get about 1/8th of a million. If you try again you may make some more money. (Take the cash ape. You’re up 685% or so!),
God damn the hero we all need to get us back to full on gamble mode,
Next level,
We need screeshots of time and date of purchase.,
Sell it man. If you're so good you can take another $2000 and do it again next week right? Its so easy you can do it again.... right?

Back away from the casino table.,
Important advice - if you're doing all or nothing plays and winning, awesome and congrats! But as we approach year end - if you're up a bunch at the end of December, figure out what your cap gains tax is on your winnings, and set that money aside and don't risk it come January

You want to be absolutely sure to avoid a scenario where you're up big but then get on a cold steak and owe the IRS for 2021 gains while you don't have the money to pay due to 2022 losses,
Hope you closed that.,
Buy 1000 used midrange gaming PCs, start mining crypto, make $200-300/day, retire,
and I suffering to make 100 bucks a day hahaha,
I am retarded.. why is this a call? Thought puts are printing in red days.,
[removed],
nice work OP. reported for hacking.,
Saw a comment on the previous post, it’s not real until it’s realized…,
When lambo,
Wait for the 137k to $100 post...,
Update please OP, SPY is 450 now Lol,
So just tell me what to buy today, ha. Calls?,
Post like this make me realize I truely am a retard.
Can we get positions on this, so i can learn from a true master?,
And here my dumb ass is just slowly buying shares of lucid and only up $2500.  Just started out though.  Hopefully I'm not too much of a moron to learn puts and calls.,
Take the money and run you ape!,
You glorious bastard!  Fuck you!  Nice work, congrats.,
Fuuuuck. 455 p 0DTE went for .01 and hit a high of 5.92. That's 592x. Fuuuuuck. Fuuuuuck.

$1k would have solved all my problems.,
Cool! Give to the needy! 😝,
Dont listen to all these pansies.  You made 135k in 10 days and your gonna let these guys convince you you got lucky.  Fuck that.  You push that 135 in and throw the dice like the boss you are.  They just jealous. Send it!,
Cool. Can’t wait to watch you eventually lose everything.,
How long will you hold?,
keep it going, you'll hit 1mil soon if theres a circuit breaker,
jezus christ,
Damm. Nice. Go for that 1 mil,
Congratulations and fuck you!,
So tomorrow bout to be a red day for spy😂,
Sale! Sale you son of a bitch!,
Beast.,
You get a Gold Star from me! Congrats!,
I need a PS5 for Xmas if you don’t mind.,
CONGRATS,
How do you do stuff like that?,
Good work 👍,

Hope you still have those diamond hands.,
Good shit,
You should go join /r/TheRaceTo10Million,
Its a good thing I'm still a retard when it comes to buying options otherwise I'd probably wrekked myself,
Dick...
Congrats,
Why not sell half, you've doubled your money like 20 times,
if youre looking for a charity to donate to - i accept checks & cash. <3.,
Cash out now,
Smart money cashed out and buys back in with 2k.  Rinse and repeat!,
Don’t get too cocky,
Teach me,
Lock in the gains, please my dude,
Take 30k out now. Or in a month you won't have a penny.,
My gay hero,
Go become a professional gambler,
Cash out bro. You made it you did it. You don’t need more than that. Time to cash out and buy your wife a nice necklace.,
Next positions?,
How the fuck do you find plays like these? I don't play meme tickers but all my picks are shit.,
How many days until its negative though?,
What shall we do tomorrow?,
Alright Nostradamus, did you buy calls or puts for tomorrow?,
Congrats and fuck you, I can only go the opposite direction,
Please withdraw most of your funds. Save yourself before its to late.  You'll yolo it away,
Take profits.  Use a portion to continue trading.,
How does this make sense. Was it heavily leveraged? How many options did u buy,
I don’t understand this. How can you earn off an option in just 10 minutes?,
So now would be a good time to take a step back and be careful,
How do I do that?,
Fuck you

Congrats,
Just cash out 3/4 of it, you already made 135k. Put it into like something less risky,
You hold that out bro. At least until the end of the month,
how do you get these insane gains? i don’t have much but i do have 2k i could spend,
You haven’t made anything until you cash out.,
Ima just say it. Git allll dat cheddar outta ther and restart with the original sum. Split it, diversify. Buy yo mamma summin nice, take yo girl to dinner. Got no gurl, hire one for the night. Make dat dream money real money my G,
Good enough to post means good enough to sell.,
Remember that if you still have that money by January 1st, you’ll have to pay taxes on your gains even if you lose everything after January 1st...,
Teach me,
Lol love to see some balls on people; even if it makes me gay.,
״if it’s good enough to screnshot - it’s good enough to sell”,
Holy fuck you're insane.,
take 100k out for the love of god,
I want to make the money, show me the way,
go big or go home! glad it works in your favor bro,
Pls stop before you end up on Benjamin's YouTube vid for the wrong reason,
Take half of it out lad,
I need to learn this power.   
I am so shitty at investing, never know what to invest in and when I do, I dont invest enough to make hardly anything, and never sure when to buy and when to sell. I don't understand what "puts" and "calls" are.,
I hate you,
How long until we see the 137k to $69 post?,
Teach us master!,
If you break the mil, be sure to remember the animal shelter needs donations, and consider putting a poor disadvantaged kid through a bachelor's program (preferably the hard sciences).  Too many people that get wealthy forget about us stuck at the ground level, don't be one of them.,
Good job!
Your Wendy's shift still starts at 5pm behind the dumpster.  Wear your standard uniform.,
Dump,
Sell it,
Damn. I could have made the $2 in my account $137!,
I'm not sure you know what "WELP" means...,
I went farther out with Jan 2023 $510 SPY calls. Hoping I don't sell at a loss when the time comes with this damn kangaroo market,
I’m to lazy to try and work this out but how did the value of both a put and call over the same thing but with one week different expiry both go up at the same time lol,
Teach me your ways,
how do people make these kind of profits? what is a put?,
This is when you pull out and restart with 2k and try to do it again. Don't go all in you might lose it all.,
What was your first play at 2k to jump start this rocket?,
Stupid but what did he stock on.,
Options are absolutely fucking retarded.,
Sell?,
Dude I get we all talk big game here, but you should absolutely cash out at least a portion of that. 25% minimum.,
Somewhere, Uncle Sam is rubbing his palms together and licking his lips.,
What price do you sell them at??,
Congrats and fuck you. I buy the rope if shit turn bad so don’t worry about it.,
Until you've taken profits.... you've made nothing.,
Cash out bro,
cash out you fool cash out,
What are you basing your trades on? SMA? VWAP? Just guessing it will do the opposite of the past few trading days? LOL....SPY 470 EOY,
Hit the right momentum for selling and you are made. But also right momentum to buy.,
Posted this on your older post, meant to post it here:

Serious question. Given the current state of the market, more specifically SPY...I want to get in a little heavier than I am. Holding around 22k in shares of SPY, still up around 15% on those shares overall. Have a few 500 jan2023 calls that I'm down about 10% on after today. If I were to sell off around 5k worth of shares and reinvest that into shorter dated calls, what would you reccomend? All on the same expiry or broken up on different exp dates? Any insight is appreciated, looking for good swings not playing weeklys.,
You don’t have it until you close,
Where do I begin to learn this?,

When they said average down, I thought they were referring to my bank account.,
Clov is being mentioned again.... buy,
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.,
Never out all eggs in one basket,
Can't wait for this piece of shit to go below 1.5 billion MC so it doesn't get mentioned here anymore. Almost there.,

I am SHOCKED it’s in the US, would have never thought that would happen 🤡,
My favorite story so far regarding omicron is the two israeli doctors that went to south africa to get omicron viral stocks, didnt get any samples and returned testing positive for the variant.

At least they managed to return with the virus for their labs :\^),
Did anyone seriously think it wasn't already in the US?,
Good thing I invested heavily in Playboy. Everyone will stay at home jerking it. The stock can only go up,
Wouldn't bears be happy as things are now sinking?,
The Omicronians are coming to harvest your Human horns,
So how long will it take to infect all of US? Plague.inc says 9months,
Im pretty sure Omicron died in the last transformers movie,
So where was patient zero? Italy? Africa? You don't know because you're a bad father!,
Oh no!

Anyways...,
Who gives a shit. Covid panic is so 2020.,
Oh no! A variant with very mild symptoms.  Let's sell everything off and screw everyone.  WTF,
Lmao based Reddit? Never heard of this,
Everyone already knew it was here and only a matter of time till it was detected.

Also, no one gives a fuck. No shutdowns, no lockdowns, no fucks given by literally anyone.,
Bullish, I just bought TQQQ calls as soon as I heard. We're pumping stocks to the moon!,
Haven't you heard? Already priced in.,
CNN is Garbage,
It’s wild they’re saying that person tested positive for Omicron 2 days ago but also that the tests can’t tell the difference between variants & it takes a lab 2 weeks,
I'd be real careful betting on much impact from this. I think it's a one or two day impact on the market, at most,
Well whop-ti-fucking-do, no one gives a shit anymore. Fuck off Covid!,
This is a fucking joke “THE FIRST CASE OF OMICRON” as if it’s a fucking anthrax mega death virus that I craft in Plague Inc. Jesus the media and the spread of information is legitimately bad as retarded fuck faces make mass fear mongering a daily occurrence.,
To get into Canada you need to be vaxxed and show negative test results yet omicron still got in. I'm thinking tunnels a la el chapo. Only way 🤣,
First case of the harmless variant.,
thats it we are all doomed.,
How is this a surprise. 

It will pass just like delta and the other covid shit.


Buy the dip pussies,
DOOR DASH CALLS NOW,
Who gives a shit.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Completely transitory.,
Wait til Megatron gets here.,
Oh no another survivable flu with milder symptoms. I’m so scared🤪,
It's a bear trap, everybody seems to have forgotten what happened half a year ago with the Delta variant. News of a new Variant of Concern went mainstream on Friday 7th May (the name Delta was only assigned on 31st May). From Friday high to Wednesday low SPY sank from 422,82 to 404,00. Bear Pride parades were being arranged, $ROPE was overbought. On 4th June SPY reached new ATH.

Stonks only go up and in the worst case daddy JPOW will just switch the infinite money printer on overdrive.,
I don’t see what the big deal is. Each year we get a flu shot and each year we end up getting it anyways. There are variants each year and Covid will be part of the norm from now on. But what does this mean for the market?? Start buying shorts??,
# ITS TIME TO ACTIVATE THAT ACCOUNT BIG SHORT MICHAEL,
"Be afraid, be very afraid" Is all they ever want us to be. C\*nts.,
*JPow reloading printer noises*,
I am Lurrrrr!,
CNN got Omicron! 😲,
"incredibly obvious thing happens" panic! Noone could predict this!,
I think omicron has the media spotlight because of the markets / money that it affects. And it affects the markets because it has the media spotlight.,
Why are people that dumb? It’s second slide on the same news. The human race deserves to be extinct,
Covid chumps and their money will soon be parted. I guess they will sell every time there is a new Greek letter. Have fun losing your money to algorithms trading on your panicky feelings.,
How did it take so long to identify Chris Cuomo?,
Gets worried 😧 

Sees it’s cnn 😯

Oh thank goodness it’s not true, we’re safe! 🥲,
Good! Let’s get this shit over with so we can get back to some green! 

PS: heard that current vaccines are effective against omicron and symptoms are not severe.,
If there's 1 case, there's already thousands. Besides which, like the common cold, covid is mutating towards being more infectious and more benign. Omicron will have a survivability rate for unvaxxed people of 99.9999586% or something.,
https://twitter.com/KoenSwinkels/status/1465906474270531589,
Honestly the best solution is to ignore the whole covid shit, I am personally tired of it and I think many are even if their too afraid to speak up!
Protect the elderly and let the world move on with their lives.

The only positive in my opinion is making piles of money on the way down and the way up due to reaction in the market.,
This News was baked in on Monday.,
We better get our 10th booster shot!!!,
Don't listen to CNN, they lie a lot,
Just gonna leave this here, as they're literally repeating the same fear porn tactic all over again even though they know it is unethical...

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Lol....Jesus this circus won't stop....,
Omicron: more contagious but almost zero lethal.,
Ah yes the omicrock-a-shit variant,
Moderna is about to announce Modena+

It’s a subscription model, inspired by Disney. For $200 a month you get access to all their vaccines - the entire collection of thousands of approved, pending, and experimental shots. 

For an extra $200,000 a month you can get copper piping tied directly from your kitchen and bathroom sink to their distribution system, along with recipes for cocktails with vaccine infusions.,
Well, I guess CNN was the real virus all along.,
Get your 107th vaccine booster shot today. Pfizer loves you,
A WHOLE ENTIRE CASE!,
Not like I expected any different from this sub, but the amount of misinformation and dumbasses in the comments is astounding.,
This is a nothing burger. Just another chance for the government to seize more control. The S African doctor that discovered this variant said the symptoms were very mild and no one had been hospitalized. It’s time for the American people to say enough is enough. No more fucking lockdowns. No more masks and shot mandates. Neither of those two stopped the virus from spreading. And yet, they keep pushing.,
It was found in California. You know the same state that is stopping the ships from unloading, wanting to keep lock downs in affect, has all the homeless and addicts that aren't vaccinated but don't die, high taxes and all around shit hole. I don't believe in the biden germ being what they claim it to be.,
Mazel tov,
This is good for AMD NVDA MSFT,
Very convenient this happens the same week of the maxwell trial….,
ermahgern!,
Glad I got those carnival puts!,
Come on they’re just trying to give you a better long term deal/investment on your stocks. 😉,
Man imagine being that muhfucca people looking at you like you muhfucca,
Oh no the black plague,
.... Bears in the gay community? I'm missing something,
Puts on airlines,
Feels like Feb 2020 all over. Deja Vu confirmed!,
I can’t believe the panic level.  Damn,
What do the first two emoji’s mean?,
HOLD ME,
Imagine still being a pussy about COVID,
Yeah; I think hedge fund supercomputers found the news before media reported on it.  This explains the sell-off.

Ughh… sobering reminder that COVID is nowhere near finished.

I dunno; I’m gonna sit out of the market for a few weeks b/c the market action has been insane the last week… I think it is beyond the point anyone can even reasonable have any idea where it’s going to go (which is already not an exact science… but fuck!!!),
Ah glad I picked up aapl puts at the top rip spy calls,
Even a wannabe 🌈🐻 such as myself is not that excited about this.  How many variants have we come across to date, there is a small short term correction and the bulls go back to taking indexes to new highs by the end of the week.  I want a real sale on some of my favourite things before Christmas so my stockings are full of Telsa's, Amazons and Apples.,
CNN sent an intern to Africa, caught omicron, came back and bam first case.,
never thought id be telling a bunch of retards they’re retards but the shot never promised you wouldn’t carry the virus, that’s like, the whole concept of herd immunity, alas.,
Million death Speedrun: any% 

America is #1,
Alright time to pump stay at home stocks.,
So, what a big deal about it? For that no one needs to be panicked. I believe the market crashing today was a calculated move by the Hedge funds. One single event cannot dictate the market. The poor fellas sell losing their investments and the Hedge funds will buy at cheap and sell again at high prices.,
or Omnicron like Bidet called it. Not a typo btw,
Didn’t they already state that this variant can be controlled with the vaccine?,
It’s only a matter of time, dammit of course it’s in California where I live. Were fucked,
All that Lets Go Brandon done pissed off that Dementia Patient so he Released the Omicron. Fucken A,
Thanks Crisis News Network!!!

Omicron spelt slightly different is MORONIC. Now... how does that make you feel?

I guess big pharm is still trying to recoup all their lost income they spent on opiate lawsuits. Won't be long before the next strain fattens up their bank accounts.,
That’s misspelled, it’s “ omiCON.,
Puts puts puts puts puts puts everybodyyyyyyy puts puts puts puts put puts,
Well, they wanted to blame China and Evergrande first, then Republicans for shutting down government, then the Nu variant but it sounded like New and useful idiots were confused and so they skipped to Xi, but that made it sound like they were blaming China again, so Omicron was just the next letter in the alphabet... but they didn't count on people seeing it's an anagram for MORONIC...  


Welcome to the MOASS.,
Omnicron these nuts in ur mouth bitch.,
Anyone else find it weird that the omicron just popped up right before the ghislaine maxwell trail and now all the news is about corona and not her trial🧐,
When did WSB become a cesspool of toxic Fox News consumers?,
Omg who cares?!?!,
who caresz,
Omicron can suck my diamond handed dick,
Who actually cares at this point I am sick of these pansies clowns power grabbing off a flu varient every day we see images of these people breaking their own rules ... Just sayin,

I’m waiting for apple to open my 162.5 puts are looking real nice I picked up at 170,
Whys the value only 12k but gain is 50k?
Edit: he sold puts yesterday at a loss and bought some more to recoup his losses. If he didn't sell puts he'd have like 80k profit,
Dow will hit 35k tomorrow, you do the math!!,

Clearly because those are puts 😂,
This dude doesn’t even understand calls and puts are two different things, truly amazing,
wait until the numbers flip to negative and then you win the game,
First one is free. Congrats and fuck you,
Buddy doesn’t even know what he bought,
Calls = Puts. Got it!,
You're going to want to take profits on those "calls" early in the morning most likely. Since they are short-dated, wouldn't take much of an upswing in price to eat your profits.

Also theta is going to eat some of your profits overnight. You don't understand what that means but just sell tomorrow before TSLA recovers.,
Okay new retard here who has started selling calls, like I totally understand how money is made on that end but what happens if a put YOU buy expires in the money??,
Good strat. Buy the opposite of what you think you’re buying and profit.,
I don’t know how options work; not enough to test my luck at least, but I do know Robinhood makes it too easy for people like me to play around with them. 

OP, unless you’re trolling everyone here search how to sell Puts on Robinhood and get yo damn money. Congrats on the dub,
Sell asap. Claim those gains,
And so it begins...,
Yah bought puts, bud.,
Hope you sold before close.,
First one is free also you have puts not calls and you make money by either selling or exercising,
First those are puts not calls.

Second the trick is to find the sell button while you're still in the green. Should be fairly simple but since you don't even know what type of options you bought you might want to start looking for it sooner rather than later.,
How to make money?

Secure profit by selling out.,
First one = free.

Second one on margin = wipeout,
Tomorrow these will all be red,
Lol this dude probably gonna sit on these “calls” til Friday,
Ignorance is bliss my man,
First option trade my ass..,
Before doing anything, sell it, take your profits and run. Please don't do it again until you know what you are doing.,
You better hope the Tesla factory blows up overnight,
This has to be a joke,
Those are puts you fucking monkey,
First ones free,
> how do I make money from this?

That's the neat part, you don't.,
yeah just diamond hand those til expiry bro,
All options = calls. Got it. Been doing it wrong this whole damn time. This retard gets it.,
fuck you. Im not even gonna throw in a congrats. Just fuck you,
That's a new strategy. Puts are interchangeable with calls.,
But the thing is did u sell it?,
Liar Liar Calls On Fire! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
He’s gonna lose it all when TSLA pump in AH lmfao,
Hold it to expiration. That's how you extract the most value 
-quoted from ThetaGang sub,
Just sell them asap then go read a book.,
This mofo just inversed  wsb without even realizing it.,
Yeah nice "calls" there retard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Yeah you bought puts and not calls you already fucked up,
You fuck tards it says puts. Always buy puts on TSLA   its literally free money 😂,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Where r calls,
Why do options the normal way? The first decentralized options platform is live, and NO kyc. Degen approved $IBFR,
First hit is always free,
This is some full blown knuckle dragging ape  shit right here.,
Lol this literally made me chuckle,
Let's see!  
*SCANNING...*  
**ERROR DETECTED:** Puts have been mistakenly referred to as calls.  
**ERROR DETECTED:** Not at least a +500% gain detected.  
Yep you're doing good.,
Hold to expiry for 👩‍🍳 💋,
Go into the option and sell to close. Then put your phone down, walk away, and put that into the s&p, if you are being serious about your first time. You probably won’t repeat it. Take the win and walk away. You hit money on roulette. Walk away while you’re up.,
Sell some hold some,
What's a stock?,
Going up against Elon ? ….. someone about to learn something,
If you don’t know what you’re doing you shouldn’t touch them. EDUCATE YOURSELF FIRST DUMBASS THERES INFORMATION EVERYWHERE,
I did this two weeks ago and lost money. Fuck me,
How the fuck is your total return less than today's return??,
Perfect example on how the first ones already free,
Make money?,
"That's the neat thing, you don't!",
U buy calls u idiot.,
Can I just say if you have this level of understanding it is extremely unsafe and unwise to use that money in that way? Like until you really understand how this work you need to be able to consider that money flushed down the toilet. 

I'm not trying to be cruel, I'm a little new here and don't use actual money yet, but is this some kind of inside joke I'm not up on?,
Dude spends 10K on shit he doesn’t even understand and it works. Meanwhile I lose my ass trying to do research. Weird huh.,
Bruh these are puts on Tesla… cash out,
I think this is proof the sub is healing,
There was a time in wsb where noobs were frowned upon. What the fuck happened.,
No idea what’s going on but I see “+”and “$” so good job,
set up a closing order with a 5% trailing stop on each in case the price jumps.,
Omg. Sell!,
OP throws $10k into something he has no understanding of. Amazing. Truly a retard.,
Please sell and leave,
Congrats and fuck you, first one is free,
You could start by charging your fucking phone.,
By the way don’t sell it, you should let it expire in the money it’s like free money,
Scary,
Let your winners ride. Don't sell these until Monday, OK?,
You fucked up,
i can tell because those are puts lmao,
Legendary post lmao,
First one is free.,
This guy totally blows up my philosophy that “Luck is the intersection of preparation and opportunity” This asshat skipped the preparation part and still got lucky. Back to the drawing boards for my life philosophy,
Add some baba put,
Just sell your up alot of money take the w,
Sell, take cash, and never buy Tesla derivatives again. Consider yourself lucky.,
You got lucky. Be careful,
That's the thing, you don't.,
How much did OP risk?,
Dude I hope you're fucking joking you lucky fuck.,
“First time with calls,” screenshot shows puts. You belong here.,
Sell your puts,
What are you at now you lucky bitch,
First ones on the house,
"First time with calls"

*screenshot shows puts*,
I can’t even do this with my fidelity account. How are people able to buy calls/puts. I’ve put multiple applications in,
Sell the pits now that your up , or risk losing a he gains if you wait,
First time with OPTIONS.,
you are doing it wrong.

Calls means the price will go up, so they are usually green. Puts obviuosly should be red.

Try to restart you computer first, and if it does not help - sell them asap before elon tweets some bullshit.,
Stop using Robinhood man. They're literally betting against you.,
Pure retard luck,
Hello my friend, this is a moderator of PornHub™. We have noticed you haven't logged in for 4 weeks, we're just checking to see that everything is okay with our biggest fan. Since you visited us last time we've updated the Gay section with many videos we know you will enjoy. See you soon.,
I fuckin love this better sell those while ya can look up some calls,

My stocks all tanked.,
omicron has the coolest name,
My blood red portfolio would like to disagree.,
Apparently the stock market cares since all I'm seen is red on this b!tch market,
It is easily.


Also, where are the GAINS!?,
If only they didn't skip the previous letter : "Look, the Xi Variant !",
I want you to know I blame this meme for today,
In OPs defense he did say “Hopefully”,
Narrator:  It wasn’t.,
r/agedlikemilk,
AGED LIKE MILK.,
They will skip naming future versions the Xi variant, because you know, it would imply China.,
Man, these stocks are going down faster than my wife in a room full of bank executives.,
Only took 7 hours for this to age like milk.,
My take is whoever is naming strains has a hard on for Transformers and Decepticons,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
*Laugh in my aeronautics company share*,
This aged like cheese,
Well, this post hasn’t aged well,
This aged horribly....,
This shit aged like milk 7 hours later. Lol,
/r/agedlikemilk,
Powell said inflation is a bigger risk to the economy, new variant + he will be more hawkish towards sooner inflation = bull trap don’t play bros!,
It’s not the new variant that’s crashing the market. 

Our retarded politicians reactions to it are.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Everywhere but the MSM and Twitter,
volatility says otherwise,
Aged like wine,
If nobody cares what the hell happened to the market once they announced the first case here in Cali...

My apple calls went to shit mid day...,
anyone who cares about this bs is a clown,
President Omicron of Chyna is pretty upset about it...,
This is actually pretty 50/50. It’s guesstimated at this point that it’s more contagious that delta, which is expected with variations. 

If omicron is more lethal, it could mean more restrictions and a juicy market dip. Buttttt if the symptoms are less severe (like a cold equivalent) it could outcompete covid to where this variant is all that’s left and essentially end the pandemic with a covid cold season. Big market pumps. This situation may be why the market is stagnant about this.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
I think without widespread lockdowns it won't cause more than a few red days here and there on news that it's getting worse, etc. If new lockdowns are announced, then people might lose their shit.,
Do you guys watch the market or..?,
Japan forcing airline industry not to book new flights.  Ramp up the fear train.,
Spoke too soon,
The market appears to care :/,
I’d be much more worried about a Theta variant with the way theta always fucks me on FDs.,
This is so relatable. The varients will never cease at this point.,
Wow that omicron actor is a sex offender!,
Big oooff.,
Literally every public health expert: The omicron variant is almost certainly in every single major country including the US

Market: I sleep

News report comes out confirming what every public health expert said.

Market: Real shit,
Jesus Christ there are literally THOUSANDS of variants floating out there. It's a virus, it constantly mutates. It's what it does. If the market keeps on shitting itself everytime someone around the world coughs, then its more retarded than me, and my mother dropped me on the head.,
honestly i havent cared about covid for what feels like years,
this confirms my bias,
I work in the department of pathology and have a PhD in biochemistry.  I want to get the following information  to as many people as I can.

For the most part viruses follow an evolutionary path to being less and less harmful but more infectious.  Odds are extremely likely that this variant will be the least deadly/dangerous variant so far, but may spread  better.

Now nothing is certain until the data is officially out, but i wouldn't be too surprised if omicron is already in the usa and is just so much less of a problem that its not being detected.  No deaths by omicron has been documented world wide:  [https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/11/29/1059723751/omicron-variant-latest-high-risk-world-health-organization](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/11/29/1059723751/omicron-variant-latest-high-risk-world-health-organization)

MSM is literally fear mongering for clicks and to push vaccines to help big pharmas bottom line.,
Lost me at delta, omicron was the nail in the coffin. Now I don't give a fuck. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
I don't care about omicron 😇🤑,
What happened to Evergrande?,
Omicron sounds like a villain in a cheesy cartoon! Let’s treat as such and never watch it and completely ignore the bullshit 💎🙌🦍,
As a Floridian (born, not by choice), we haven't given a FUCK since like July, 2020,
Media wants people to panic even though we don't know shit yet. It's a sad state as usual.,
This post didn't age so well.,
When Fauci and Biden both couldn't pronounce it right, u knew it wasn't a big deal.,
Considering that omicron symptoms are basically cold symptoms, and that the common cold is technically also a coronavirus.... Yeah.,
Who knew viruses mutated?!,
tell that to my AAL calls.,
everything i'm seeing out of SA studies is showing reduced symptoms.  less lethality.,
Isn’t that the name of the planet Lurr the big green alien king from futurama is from?,
uh huh,
Guess you haven't seen the market for the last week...,
Why can’t we get variants of good stuff too?,
Y'all do remember he DIES in the end, right.,
Nobody vaccinated cares…,
The data that is coming seems to indicate that omicron has a lower mortality than the current most prominent variant delta.,
Spy Bounce off 50 day or previous low. I don’t see more than that. BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!,
Wait I'm not yet done buying the dips,
RULER OF OMICRON PERSEI 8,
apparently not,
I wish I knew this morning what I know now.,
New covid DLC? Pog!,
Its here to stay like the flu. I'm gonna get shots probably because I don't wanna lose my smell but  yeah who cares at this point all the people at risk can easily access the care they want.,
Omnicron is actually super bullish for markets. If the reports are true and it is high transmission but low death rate, it will become endemic as the dominant covid and will just be like a new flu. Things will ACTUALLY get back to normal.,
Oh no we have to keep wearing masks and distancing as opposed to before where we were wearing masks and distancing,
Lol omicron virus is less lethal than the prior ones. The future variants will probably decrease in lethality as time progresses, some of y’all need to chill,
Dude I thought you guys just liked silver,
People are more worried about how governments will react with lockdowns etc,
Wonder when is theta coming.,
Oh jeez. Guess I’ll just have another minor sinus infection soon despite vaccines and boosters and hand sanitizer.,
I can’t wait until the harsher travel restrictions biden is supposed to put in place tomorrow!,
True everyone is going to catch it let’s just stop,
This aged well,
We’ll see tomorrow as the first case in California,
Fuck the govt.,
RemindMe! One Year,
Well one stock for me was down QSR -10.85 over all and my others were up for most of the day,
It’s crazy how hard the msm fear mongers over something that has happened so many times already.. it’s like “HORRY SheEt! Why is it so dark already?” It’s not like the earth has seasons or anything.. fucking retards,
It's almost as bad a being spammed to death by crypto and WSB bullshit,
Inflation is fake. Omicron dogshit. I’m crying in pain rn. Plz pump…,
Stock market cares apparently,
Fast forward 2 weeks, well timmy's dad passed away. Guess he should have cared,
Narrator voice: It wasnt the sentiment,
Bad take.,
My life has been back to normal (or at least like 95% normal) since April. I'm going to do my booster at some point in the next week. I'm literally not worried about this from a personal health standpoint, since I've only been sick once in my adult life, and from an economic standpoint, stock prices falling means retirement is on sale.,
I can’t help but think the caption should be 

Omicron omicron we got omicron here

See nobody cares.,
Didn't age well.,
This is fucking nonsense and a reason for motherfuckers to sell. Fuck this shit. Fucking sheep,
Rename it the Brandon variant and get rid of it.,
What ever happen to covid 19?,
This aged badly,
Literally this was the same reaction when COVID first became a thing. But aight,
But also the same guy who said: "Hello, nice boy. Uh, nice boy. Nice dinosaur. I thought you were one of your big brothers, you're not so bad. You're not so bad.",
Just wait until the decepticon variant kicks in. Then we’re fucked.,
It’s the sentiment about covid in general in Texas,
What the hell does this have to do with wallstreetbets,
It's not the sentiment. Damn paper hands out there selling like crazy.,
My losses say they still very much care.,
Under 40 you have a higher chance to die choking on food but jab me harder daddy 🤡,
Alright we need mass movement here. Fuck covid. Let's move on.,
Seriously, who gives a flying fuck anymore, let alone ever imho.,
Who knew we’d be more immune to FUD.,
People are getting tired of this crap.

A lot of people are going to get butt hurt over this in 2022.

Others will sit back and enjoy watching the fallout.

.,
Thought I was looking at the first meme of a HermanCainAward winner.,
Should have been since day 1 tbh. “Stay away from people that are sick!” Funny how there’s a new “variant” that has even more cold-like symptoms seemingly every season that most people get a cold.

Edit: added should have,
It is for me and most people I know. Really with all the variants. Since I don't hang out with too many 'progressives', I don't have that whiny, nagging, pro-pharma loving atmosphere around.,
Literally the post above yours on my feed... https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/r6e60b/sigh\_of\_relief\_in\_south\_africa\_as\_omicron\_variant/,
....Or we could stop blowing the dog whistles of vaccine mandates, mask mandates, etc

And, instead actually bother to prepare for something before it fucking arrives.

Smart decisions give you no reason to panic.,
I went to the gym yesterday and I think it was more packed then it ever was pre-COVID. No one gives a shit. 95% of people take their mask off after their 3 steps past the front desk.,
NOBODY CARES…. Except FAKE NEWS💯,
The media can go fuck it self now,
It's so nice to see how the average person is no longer falling for the media's fearmongering to get clicks as much as they were before.,
It’s been my sentiment since the beginning. No masks, no shots, no changes to my lifestyle, never been sick and neither has anyone else in my family. 

Main reason this matters is what will J-pow do.,
Its not the variant that were all afraid of, its the radical government reaction to it that is frightening,
Definitely my sentiment,
Too bad redditors on certain subs are actively hoping it’s a bad variant lol,
There will always be a new variant as soon as you all seem to be getting on with your lives.,
Yes, it is the sentiment. They blew their wad trying to frighten and control the world on the first attempt.,
It is for me 😂 fuck all these variants,
Only people who care are the Covid  Narcissist, you know, the ones that wear a mask inside their car while driving alone and shame you for not doing the same.,
I wish I could downvote this more than once,
Lots of ignorance in this thread sheesh. If you are refusing to get vaccinated please refuse to enter a hospital as well, vermin.,
It becomes more and more apparent to me with each post like this that zjz only gets triggered when people talk bad about Republicans.

Imagine not caring about a development in an ongoing pandemic lmao. Probably the people who haven’t cared enough about it all along to get vaccinated or wear masks. Can’t be bothered to do anything to help out, but ask “can’t this shit be over already :(((“.,
Get your vaccine, keep aping on. Don't get the vaccine: you get sick, lung damage, go on ventilator, die before seeing the MOASS.,
Seeing as they've never even proved ANY of the other 'variants' to exist, yeah this is now the attitude. 

In fact, this is how I've felt the entire time, about the entire 'pandemic'. 

Imagine a pandemic so deadly, it doesn't affect annual excess deaths AT ALL, and you need to be tested to even know you have it,
Wow This must be where the real people live in Reddit,
It’s pretty simple why. If you’re vaccinated, this variant isn’t any worse, so no reason to worry any more. If you’re not vaccinated, despite it being worse on you than delta, you probably don’t care anyway. Didn’t care enough to get vaccinated in the first place, why start now?,
1st US case detected in California.,

>rotation from growth into value

I fucking hope so, my value positions have never been more value,
If the head of JP Morgan tells you to buy, you probably should be selling tbh.,
Ending sign, ok, I need start digging basement then. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Institutions dumping and telling retail to buy so that they can keep selling at higher price. Makes sense,
Makes sense, we're almost at the end of the alphabet,
I'll bet JPM is selling like crazy.,
You guys are in a pandemic?

-the market,
This is like finding an open jar of dip in the back of the fridge. Might be good, might lead to shitting the bed.,
I always do the opposite of what the media tells me,
But that means money printing ending,
Sounds like JP wants to f us,
I only listen to one JP and it sure as hell isn’t Morgan,
INVERSE,
Tell me when we get to omega. That's the last letter in Greek alphabet. There will be no more mutation thereafter.,
Always take medical advice from the head of a bank.   What could go wrong.,
There are other forces at play in the market other than the pandemic.  That’s a known right now.  Inflation and tapering?  And China property market on the brink of collapse.  I’ll be buying the collapse not the dips on the way down.,
Don’t take pandemic forecasting from a bank…

Would you get legal advice from a beauty salon, or have an accounting firm design and plant your garden?

Would you take financial investment advice from your physician, or from an investment advisor?

I can’t give too much info, but I’ll just say that folks at banks are not qualified to reasonably comment on matters like pandemics.,
Can I get a second opinion?? Goldman… whatcha got?,
If it is the end, the media will manufacture some new shit to scare people.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Pandemic ending, just disregard inflation and fed shrinking their balance sheet. nothing to see here 👀,
I'll take the advice from a banker that thinks he's a molecular geneticist... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop),
...I was going to, until JPM told me to. Now im scared shitless,
Wildly optimistic, but it does make some sense. When a pandemic becomes endemic it often gets weaker, at least partly because the stronger variants die with their hosts. Fuck it I'm buying.,
Warren Buffet: "More long-covid is great for the bottom line.",
Then why the fuck are they selling and shorting everything?,
so a big dip is coming then,
JPMorgan can hold their own bags, thanks.,
Yes buy the dip, sincerely a bag holder #JPMORGAN,
did u guys even read the article before screaming inverse? it says sell growth buy value, which is sound advice,
Buy the Sour Cream and Onion dip dang it!,
BIOCEPT

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Time to sell guys,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
How do you get from a new variant to now it means the pandemic is over 🤷‍♂️,
Are they daft or are they daft??,
I still don't know anyone who was really fucked up or died from it. I know lots that got COVID, but everyone was like.... yeah it was a cold. They were all vaccinated though. I'm buying and holding u risk-off FD's.,
What stocks are dipping and are most buying?,

I am here randomly,
500 I'll take 2500 and you got a deal,
I only had 200 shares at an average cost around 8, I cut my loses, now I'm losing money on Uranium.,
Oh boy that 500 could be a life changer 😬,
I’m not sure I’ll live that long. I’m 35,
Make it 1000 im in,
Here to claim the $500 it’s all good man in a year you’ll look at that part of the timeline and laugh cause you thought about selling,
I'm here for those $500,
It's at the bottom now, get ready for takeoff,
Never gone Happen. Wish is dead. 
Did you ever use wish? Bet No..,
If it hits $10 and I happen to be the winner, I'll take 50 shares as payment. I want to get right in at the top.,
Good luck fella,
I hope it does. Good luck,
Let me know about that 500,
Me,
Good luck! 👍🏽,
I’ll take free money,
I’ll take 100,
You have to feel good knowing that $500 is safe, you’ll never have to worry about paying out.,
IMO, Wish has an irreparable and awful reputation, and will slowly just bleed out as nobody trusts to buy anything from them. I think it is on a slow march to death, and the IPO was just a last ditch effort for the managements to cash out.,
How random are we talking?,
Can I get an advance on my $500?,
Hello. I am here.,
You’re probably going to need a random someone to send you $500 tbh,
Liar,
Some retard would just take that $500 and dump it into Wish😂,
I'll take your $500 and lose it all on $WISH,
Alright I'm going to flip a quarter if it lands on Abe Lincoln side I'll give OP $500,
Guessing you fell for the "Its going to the moon" hype. At least your bags are still packed.,
You got this my guy!,
Keep the $500 bro you gonna need it when WISH gets delisted,
If hit 10 again, please pm me. I will sell it with minimum lose.,
That’s nice of you and I’m super hopeful as well. $500 would be life changing for me especially so close to the holidays!,
Zack Morris is gone make wish great again with a big squeeze.,

The original photo was of Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov, who was Stalins main NKVD executioner. Stalin had him killed and the photo of them together was altered. Not sure what this means tho

Edit: i dont speculate as to the intent of the tweets by one of the weathiest guy on earth...,
Splish splash, throwing some friends in the pool.,
Some fuckker already made a Coin based on this ,I'm sure of it.,
You have to be honest, Twitter's new rules are dystopian af,
Vengeance will come in the form of a longer darker beard.,
Elon is more than likely on a hit-list, of being banned soon. Hopefully not, but the new rules and everything being written in place, is a major concern.,
Get woke go broke twitter.,
Here we have the classic reddit downvote war where people can't like a joke because somebody they don't like made it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Whooosh 

Wtf is this?,
I think its lost on half the people commenting that Elon changed the faces of Stalin to Parag Agrawal (New TWTR CEO) and Yezhov's face to Jack Dorsey. HAHA. I feel like this is so easy to see though. Fuck, our generation is stupid.,
It’s the new Twitter CEO pushing Jack Doesey into the river to die.  New Twitter CEO said “all white people are racist”, and that would include Jack,
Ez putts,
HAHAHAHAHA WOW HAHAHA WHAT A MEEM XD XD HAHAHAHA.






 fuckin simps,
Jack did not have voting right at Twitter board. So Elliot played its game. I wonder how they are going to monetize Twitter. Or he may be back after a few years just like good old times. But he has significant voting control in Square. And Block is best positioned for metaverse. Godspeed.,
Jack got Noah'ed 🤣

^(... if you know, you know.),
"IF I DEFEND ELON MUSK LIKE HES MY HUSBAND AND FATHER THEN I WILL BE JUST LIKE HIM"

Let the downvotes commence...,
Elon Musk is cringe,
That new twitter guy is even more woke them the previous one... 🤣,
Cringe lord Elon*,
Gotta admit, Elon has a sense of humor.,
Elon stirring the pot,
This sub has just turned into an Elon Musk jerk off station. Wtf happened,
Rich, nerdy, weirdos that were bullied in high school are now in positions of power.
What could go wrong?,
I don’t get it. Why do so many people here like Elon Musk … he’s so full of himself,
lord? Wtf you kissass, boot licking slaves call that Elon guy a lord? I swear you peasants know your place.,
This is the kind of meme a mentally challenged boomer posts and wonders why their entire family and friends no longer talks to them,
Dorsey? The the guy that banned Trump? Pretty sure his day is coming. I live in town that has up Trump signs with Pence crossed out 😂Dorsey can go to Canada with the other Nazis. Fuck him.,
Tote legit bro,
Elon is a shitstain. Its pretty good that Jack stepped down, but to equate Twitter with Stalin is the most cringey framing a Billionaire can put on this topic. Agitprop motherfucker needs to fuck off to Mars yesterday.,
That's very rich coming from someone who sold 6 billion in stocks in a week,
For those who don't get the joke 

https://www.history.com/news/josef-stalin-great-purge-photo-retouching,
put your hands up for elon,
This is how the people from the “Generation Jones” do photo editing. In this case, the original is Stalin and his boy Yezhov (equivalent to Hitler’s Himmler) and the second one is after Stalin got rid of Yezhov because he was overstepping his boundaries. Yezhov deserved it.,
Trolling for ban,
It means the great short seller purge has started…..,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
The cabal salute,
memes, the greatest power in the universe(internet),
well he's gonna get twitter gulaged soon,
"Hi Jack. Bye Jack",
Musk and Dorsey probably teaming up on another business.

just hasnt been announced yet.,
But what does it mean and how does it reflect doge???,
i will call the louvre,
Trust me this confirms the stock split 🚀🚀🚀🚀,
Why does Elon want to Bezos himself? Poor guy. Low self esteem about being bald?,
SPLASH!!!,
A lot of Twitter cocksuckers in the chat today 🥸🥸🥸🥸,
There’s the dip,
I’m surprised he didn’t mention pooping in this meme,
Little beardy guy's been shopped into the first photo, not out of the second photo. He's got a halo for chrissakes.

No idea what th fuck is going on.,
He is basically saying fuck you Jack, ya broke bitch I can have u OFFED 😜,
Kinda ironic considering he airbrushed the Tesla founders out of history,
DWAC..ers are licking their chops,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This was posted just before all my gains disappeared.  He was warning us and we were to blind to see it?

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),
Elon is cringe AF,
The only thing really worthy about Twitter is Breaking news like no other platform - everything else stinks.,
And with it any care for the 1st amendment on Twitter. I'm very curious what the play will be on the stonk,
wowe so funnie,
He looks twice as dumb as Jack Dorsey which is scary.,
The phrase “meme lord Elon” makes me want to uninstall this app so bad,
Didn’t Elon do the exact same thing with Tesla?,
No one's posts make me cringe anywhere near as much as Musk's,
remember that twitter is mostly US content, and the rest of the world really doesn't care (japan is second but again it's almost unused in every other country) and remember also that twitter has the smallest population between popular social media.,
He’s gonna change the world…right after he gets his weekly media attention. Dude is gross thirsty like a kardashian,
I like that,
it's 2001 and we are posting Hitler memes

anyone know what kind of weed Elon is smoking today?,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN!!>>?,
White Silence is White Violence,
So…. Twitter call options…?,
Elon Musk is a 13-year-old.,
Haha so relatable! We should do everything he fucking says forever,
If this pic doesn’t get you going I don’t know what will,
Elon musk MAY be killing people and dumping them in the ocean as some sort of sick game. His tweets lately seem to indicate 'dropping friends off at the pool' and this picture means that he has gone full super villain.,

How far on the spectrum do you have to be to find CLOV in mclovin and meme it? This is some high quality shit here guys. I'm impressed.,
So happy to have jumped that boat.,
Normally I hate about 80% of the memes on here, but this one is top notch. Kudos,
Clov and WISH classic🤣🤣,
Clovtards rise up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
And I bought both. Fuck. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,
Best meme ever!!!!,
Hehe :D,
This meme is flawless.,
Mint! How I feel reading the sub these days,
Lol. Every time I think Clov can’t reach all time lows, better believe it delivers. Day after fucking day.,
Oh man, this was amazing !

I am losing a lot of money, but posts like this are hilarious.,
Solid DD,
I bought $ CLOV @ 10.55 and sold at 4.85..more than 55% loss. A terrible loss for me,
Nice.  Funny af,
Had a good laugh. Had a good cry.,
ZMG, this is hilarious, just absolutely sublime. Good job, OP!,
Thank you for this meme. I sold my CLOV position for a -69% loss unironically, but at least a good meme came out of it.,
This might be in my top 10 favorite memes for this Sub well done.,
Ho-lee shit whoever made this is an ape among gods 🦍💎🙌🏼🦍,
This one is great lol.  Actually made me laugh out loud.,
meDWACn,
Jesus, people still buying CLOV?,
Superbad.  Classic retard entertainment. 

By coincidence, I had just sent the exact clip to a small group of friends on a private Whatsapp group yesterday.  One of them called it "lowbrow".

How do you people have this much money to burn?,
You could have bought a Porsche and coke then crash it in to the river and ended with the same result, but with a lot more fun involved,
Well you’ve got it down! Well done!,
F,
*unzips pants* i need this so bad,
I never fuck with currencies, you have to track a cross section of geopolitical and a countries economic position relative to other nations. I'm too dumb for that,
Compression interest babby!! *CompouNd,
Lol what’s your PnL,
Wow..you lost a lot of money,
OP, You botched the title but it still somehow works.,

10% of portfolio down the drain.. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
PLTR has proven to be the most retarded Play I’ve made this year. Since earnings I’ve earned myself the $3000 tax deduction this year plus my IRA has lost 3 years of gains thanks to PLTR. Guess I’ll keep holding these bags,
Draw me like one of your French girls,
Gold,
Lost 2700 earlier this year. Then in the tech rally it went to -700 and now it is back at 2400! The circle of life amirite,
On another, completely unrelated note, my January 22 LCID puts are up 40% today!,
I'm down 30% this month... guuuuh,
I just got finished watching that. I still cry.,
Dwac baby,
The only thing that was up today was my hopes, but then reality struck,
Like I say retards and stocks do not mix...,
https://youtu.be/WMiRi7e-AkU

The market was Never Meant to sink.,
I'd care about my losses if I planned to sell,

So Calls in BABA and WISH?,
>Take gains where you want 

What gains?,
My end of the world 17jun2022 spy $100 put hedge just went up 65% today 🤣🤣🤣,
Wait you guys have gains???,
I’ve gone boomer money and gone all in on Disney, see you in five years,
I didn't even make money on easy mode. I'm gonna need a crash helmet for intermediate mode.,
All my portfolio is red apart from GME,
Just say “buy the dip” next time. It’s less words.,
buy costco, calls on TP (NFA),
This post has r/stocks kind of vibe. Makes too much sense for it to belong here.,
“Remember, stocks don’t need much of a reason to go down, and they need even less of a reason to go back up.”

Best market advice I’ve seen in here!,
$WISH is never recovering, is it? 💀,
I’m waiting for shit to really hit the fan. My biggest mistake was not buying more in March 2020. Now I have 65k sitting in the bank waiting for a severe crash to load up. This is just a tiny correction,
All my money into MSFT and AMZN and I don’t look at it for 10 yrs.,
You could be right. Or we could have another +10% retard strength run. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
Op…this is the best time to stack…yeah easy mode has been turned off, but volatility is beautiful and volatile markets is the best way to make generational wealth overnight. I love this shit,
Is NNDM a protective play since its trading far below its cash value?,
The silver lining is that they're not going to stop printing because they can't because a substantial drop in the market is a national security risk. 


It's like we're watching a game of chess and the media keeps analyzing it like its a game of checkers and people are like "oh, durr, ya, maybe he will get a triple jump and get the king!"


No. Just look at the board. This isn't rocket science, it's checkmate in _never_ because they're going to keep adding whatever pieces they need to keep the game going.,
what are the tickers for companies that sell brain cells?,
So buy more GME Feb calls? Got it.,
Buy commodities.,
Shit in my pants.... wait, where are my pants ?,
Bear traps every month till the "market crash" narrative stops. People never learn,
But kind sir, what to do about the margin calls?,
Holding on for dear life and picking up some daily gains to ease the pain,
His taper in June is already too late. Inflation is going to be mooning beyond our wildest fantasies by then,
Yeah I don’t have gains

How are you guys getting gains?,
Let me sum this up: “Buffet that shit.”,
We've still got a long time til the rate hike actually happens. This is just a slight correction so far, I think easy mode is still on.,
$MSFT CEO sold [half](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-sells-half-his-shares-in-the-company/%3Famp%3D1) his shares…,
Can you buy stocks off a private company? Would you have to contact them and all that bs just wondering because some company I’m trying invest in are private,
Rate my investment strategy.

I buy $1000 worth of either asx200 or an etf alternating bi monthly with a fee of $2. If there are 3 days of red I buy another $1000. If at ath and a spike of 1% in one day I sell everything. I usually make about 10% quarterly because this cycle always happens before earnings but I never get divitend payouts.,
Consumer stocks 👎
Infrastructure stocks 👍,
Maybe time to play the downside with SPXS & UVXY,
So, what are looking at buying?,
What 'discount' stocks are you thinking about??,
Gains? My portfolio is on the rag son. Welp there is always 2023,
Lol I re-assessed after getting G’s last time. carefully selected positions (clearly not careful enough) and still got railed,
I’m already dead,
Easy mode is just to invest in banks and banking adjacent stocks.,
CCL is going bankrupt. PUTS,
I reckon this is the great
Purge where all, truly dogshit stocks, are going to tumble to the point of being delisted.

Good post OP.,
Just buy gme ?,
Ur in the wrong plaace,
Buy $F people, for the love of god stop throwing huge money at stocks that only exist in theory. Ford at $19 today is unbelievably underpriced. The amount of positive catalysts Ford has is absurd without even taking the U.S. gov essentially will SUBSIDIZE sales of F-150 lightnings by giving $12+k IMMEDIATE discounts. Not tax credits redeemed as taxes, but literally a huge discount that’s applied at the dealership. 

Oh, and that huge catalyst only applies to union built vehicles that are priced reasonably. Meaning GMs hummer will not qualify(price), rivian will not qualify(non union), and most importantly TESLA WILL NOT QUALIFY (not union/price). 

What I’m trying to say for those who still don’t understand is THE U.S. gov has decided it’s going to make sure Ford succeeds. Stop buying stupid OTM weeklies and giving your money away. Buy ford and build your positions.,
This ain’t the bottom.,
Can't wait to watch you gain a whole 2% per year with your boomer plays.   Maybe some day you will realize the error in your bad assumptions.,
Buy SNDL on discount brothers! They'll be the only source of food in the coming weedtopia after the Omicranians invade.,
I bought right before this dip and now my savings account is empty,
Selling my blackberry,
Puts ?,
The only stock I want to get rid of is paysafe, bought at $4.20 thinking I got it at a discount while it keeps going down ($3.40 at close).

Idk if should wait as my initial plan or cut my losses and go for something solid,
See V was what I thought a winner, shits at 52w low.. thought MA As well.. 52w low.. BA? 52w low.. tech seems to be the only thing holding up,
For what it's worth,  the quants are saying short AMZN and buy CVX and PSX.,
Just like this post doesn't belong here neither does this comment. Bought an $AMD $130C leap exp Jan 2023 today at the close.,
You had an easy mode all this time?,
Stocks only go up, zoom out,
What kinda dip is everyone talking about here?? French Onion; Salsa, Queso, Buffalo Ranch?? Please; some recommendations on what Dip you all want us to buy..,
It’s all priced in,
Why/How did dwac rocket near close today?,
Or just hedge the market by buying the stock of that dude with the small wee wee,
Great advice, thanks for taking the time to type this out.,
Survive what?...just seen my Clov losses and almost took it to heart!,
TLDR: rotate out of momentum stocks,
You mean stonks don’t go up always?,
YOLO PUTS,
Alternatively

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
My portfolio is 50% GME and 50% long term put options against various banks.

&#x200B;

Bring the thunder.  Bring the lightning.,
Keep portfolio, buy VIX calls. Up 1000% yesterday turned out alright in the end,
>you need to start using your brain

Don't take gains 3 weeks before the tax cutoff... bruh. I get what ur saying and it's correct, ur timing is premature.,
Use your brains you say?

That's quite bold of you to assume I have a brain to use, sir.,
Lmao this assumes I didn’t YOLO,
Instructions unclear. WISH and CLOV now make up 100% of my portfolio 🤷🏻‍♂️,
TLDR: stonks stopped always going up for a few days and now retards think they can see the future,
I don't have any of those. I do have grains, though.,
What the heck should we buy?,
What are your top 5 picks for 2022?,
>with solid growth prospects and good fundamentals


Funda-what?,
I have bought three traunches of BABA so far because I am stupid. $145, $130, $124. Sitting on $30k worth of shares. (similar positions in V and PYPL).,
Yep... This has been my feeling.,
You’re saying $T will stop selling its butthole behind Wendy’s and become the boomer stock we all want it to be?,
I was told stocks only go up… what the fuck, bro?,
Mate my portfolio is made up of expired spy options its already in the shitter.,
Start using my what?,
Righttttt my gains… 👀,
this is a great time to have some cash on hand and buy some shares in great companies,
I'm just gonna stay in cash and options for now,
Wish I read this… this morning 🥲,
Time to buy Block,
What about MRNA IT was going up and today just crash why? it is a Covid stock,
Me either, just going to hold,
This is an opportunity to pick up some solid stocks at a discount. Everything, even stocks that aren’t dependent on huge growth assumptions, is getting crushed because of the latest headlines. Choose wisely and you can profit from this.,

Most likely but with more 0’s,
Congratulations! A word though, you need to remember that he had to fight his investors to stay in his position.,
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*,
Is there so few bears that actually make money that everyone has to compare themselves to burry?,
This biggest problem with going short and succeeding is as follows:

It feels incredible, it is such a rush to go against nearly everyone else and win. However, this usually doesn't work. So you get addicted to that feeling and keep trying to recreate it until you lose a ton of money.

Examples for me: Shorted Snapchat in winter 2018. Shorted oil market right before COVID. Did I make a lot of money? Yes. Did I end up losing even more chasing that high? Yes.,
Many more 0’s,
3 more zeros. And a bunch of angry emails and phone calls.,
Add 000000000,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Man why did I buy calls,
Did you close out your positions?,
Letttsssgoooo,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Except he made "wife's boyfriend" money.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259),

The name is Bond, Junk Bond!,
*No Time To Buy*,
Almost bought 100 puts on SPY around noon today... would have been up $60,000 so of course I didnt buy them because that would have been profitable and I hate money,
What a moron. Just keep your mouth shut. I wonder how many senators were able to sell just before this news broke?,
This meme was valid.,
Austin Powells,
O-o-h Powell things are gonna get easier


O—o-h Powell things’ll get brighter 


Someday yea,

We’ll print it together and the dollar will come undone,
I printed the original one and put it on the wall of my office at my hedge fund job.  May have to take it down now...,
People act like a pandemic could have been snuffed out by half the American society being vaccinated and the other half still swigging bleach.

Traders shouldn't complain about short-term inflation being tied to the health of the virus...since we cant seem to take care of the public's health due to conservative conspiracy theorists,
Whenever congress wants to tank the market, they call him for testimony.,
Is Jpow allowed to trade? He probably shouldn’t be right?,
Lmao. The shit you retards come up with,
I made bank on SPY puts today, and I’m kinda pissed that I sold too soon. Although I made thousands, in hindsight I left too much on the table.,
Damn that’s good bro,
Brought to you by AMC theaters. 🚀,
I think today was my biggest single day loss…. Really need a green day tomorrow.,
Member that time Cathie wood said we are about to enter a period of deflation,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
Yes!,
The Fed is pretending they're going to keep tapering, in reality as soon as stocks sell off to any substantial degree they will reverse course.,
Idk, probably Powell right about now

 "It was just a prank bro, inflation was never transitory.",
But stocks are an asset.  Shouldn't they go up with inflation?  Why puts?,
You really missed No Time To Call?,
Brrrrrrrrrrr?!?  :,(,
I just really don’t think the government would lie to us to reduce panic. It’s never happened!,
Whatever the fed says the opposite is true so if he says inflation isn't transitory it turns out it was transitory.,

Yeah expected, high growth stocks are an obvious mistake, now let me tell you about Gourd Futures…,
$SQ $PYPL $MELI $TDOC $CRM $APPS $PLTR $CVNA,
I kept fucking shorting and that didn't work out...

So I went long growth and fuckin maxed out my Roth on growth for November.

FUCK FUCK FUCK MOTHA FUCK FUCK YOU,
You guys did good in October, September, August, July, June....?,
just don't sell.,
my account is down -40% in November, i feel u,
Just wait. Its december's turn to stretch your holes out,
kangaroo market is not for everyone,
FAANG is not high growth?,
Are you sure it's not "starting gambling in MEME stonks" ?,
Money losing tech stocks and rising interest rate don't mix well. No matter how high the revenue growth is.,
SPY went down 4%, that’s no correction,
Those are some real bedroom eyes there,
Nothing like getting burned by Kathie Wood's wonderful ETFs... good thing I didn't put much into it.,
Basically all Paypal investors right now.,
Mama now,
The timing of your entry along with other people's was probably already priced in.,
Stop 🛑 666,
\+EM stocks,
Is it MAANA now?,
market correction?  is that why all my stonks are sinking?,

It will go up, down or sideways,
Even though I've been an ape since Dec, I still find this meme hilarious.

Buying more if it dips below 160,
I like gme and i like this meme,
OP’s back complaining about the apes. At least this one gave me a chuckle.,
Our beloved stock. They massacred my boy. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
Bro fuck you😂😂,
Direct register your likes so the apes can't drown your post in the dark pool.,
Someone sold for a loss 🤣,
Didn't they report GME having a 126% short interest like yesterday?,
This will age like milk,
Pretty Solid self own.,
GME is the only play, I’m sry.,
Kenny gave me 29 bucks and a blowie behind shitadel so I post this,
Good lord. The state of this sub.,
Bullishhhh,
We have no faith in your ability to identify macro-economic trends,
I’m not even in GME… but your replies show that you’re an insufferable person. 

Fucking Christ, why do you care so much? You sound more retarded than the apes.,
How's that tilray stock doing there buddy?

Looks like going back further than 12 days has you talking about other things than gme too might I add.

Edit:
Wasn't tlry my mistake see post below OPs comment. Actually paid attention second time around.

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r6qc0e/apes_strong_together/hmvhsmh?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),
The night is darkest before the dawn,
lol what a shitpost,
Enjoy your day. It will be short lived.,
I’m ashamed to say I’ve seen every comment and believe them,
It ain't right what they done to my boy  :\*(,
Are you really trying to say that this market is fair and not manipulated?  Gtfoh,
Looking at this shills post history, he clearly was into it at first and then paper handed at some point  or because he obviously didn’t understand the DD, which no logical person could deny if they actually understood it. And to this day goes out of his way to blast “apes” i guess for him losing money.,
As long as posts like this continue to appear, the apes have the ball.

I don't think OP understands how weakness is shown with each and every attempt to dissuade the public about how math works.

You can't short something more than 100% and expect happy results every time. You **can** do everything in your power to hide the debauchery, albeit temporarily.

Emphasis on the "temporarily". Apes are patient.

It'll be fun to watch it unravel - along with the sanity of people who missed-out due to their unwillingness to accept that several loopholes can now be exploited. The playing field has been leveled and nothing is going to be the same again. 

...sorry!

So enjoy the crash - and always find comfort you can become an NPC - the universe needs them too! 

Embrace the replacement and try to pretend you made the best decision - money isn't everything, ya know!,
This is how it feels talking about AMC/GME now ;(,
My fave is how they’ve been in the endgame for 11 months now.,
The apes are fuming lmao maybe you cant fully understand how markets work in one year from reddit conspiracy theory posts!,
I don't know why apes are even still here. They constantly talk about how WSB is compromised yet they stick around because they're obsessed with us.,
Bought 200 more AMC today at discount price 🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎✊💎✊✊,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958),
Oh man gotta love the apes & their dedication. Have to give it to em though can’t lie. Those guys fuck














Each other.,
If the price goes under 145 then this post has some validity. I’ll be loading up at 170 when they confirm Omnicron has spread to New York,
Couldn't the hedge funds just also buy GameStop stock and get rich alongside you? Checkmate MOASS.,
Hoes mad.,
Where is $100 mill floor or ceiling? 😂😂😂,
They are panicking, doubling down because they are scared.  Buy the dip Bois!,
Lol delusional fuckheads,
Everyday is a bulltrap,
Hahahha this is us and proud of it!,
You must live a sad life.,
how many ppl in this subreddit are still in amc and gme. havent seen much,
My quick bb swingtrade is now a long dooooooooo....,
Thought I was in the Webull comment section for a sec lol. Couldn't have nailed it better.,
It’s too accurate 😂💀😂💀,
Lmao,
> Bro read the DeeDee bro I swear bro I just grew a wrinkle bro today's the day bro infinity pool my shares bro don't forget to vote bro don't forget to drs your shares bro,

ok so can the market stop being a gay bear / confused kangaroo then,
Take solace in the fact that the most successful COVID variant would be one with no noticeable symptoms as then it's more likely to spread.,
Lol no

>The drugmaker is now conducting in vitro testing to confirm the response against a combination of all the omicron mutation,
2 Doctors in Israel that got the omicron say they didn’t feel it so much and one of them said that he met with so many peoples and none of them got infected, I’m not saying this is should be an example as it need to test on many more peoples but base on the information around the world and from Africa this variant not worsen than the Delta, some say even weaker symptoms, Companies will update their vaccine anyway as fast as they can and I believe that they will recommend another booster shot from current vaccine to make immune systems stronger,
Nobody will know much about anything until we get real-world data.

All we know for sure is cases in South Africa have increased about tenfold in the last week. Their percent of positive tests is also way up.

We won't know shit about real world deadliness, potential immune escape, or treatments for at least a week or two.,
It works on what? Something that doesnt kill you?who cares...your virus story ship has sailed....try anthrax or super duper scary AIDS or  lefty ebola.,

I posted about VIR a few times, still holding my 10 55c 12/17. Waiting to hit $100 so I can break even this year.,

Now a days market is mad so better cash out when u feel to take screenshot.,
When being a bear starts making retail money consistently- the market will go on a bull bender 👀,
Hoping my account looks like tomorrow on apple puts 😈
Edit: sold at 3.10 bought at .26,
What does your all time look like?,
see you behind the dumpster,
Fk McDonald. I work at Wendys and it’s nuggets are so much better. Oops my manager is telling me there’s a customer behind the dumpster again. BRB.,
It's ok to have 🌈 🐻 tendancies, glad you are making money jajaja,
Hell yeah fuck McDonald’s lol,
Bulls and bears make money pigs get slaughtered,
Bought far otm puts or near atm?,
Good enough to screenshot good enough to sell. The bell curve will complete soon,
Gay bear women?,
What’s the gay bear thing about? Genuinely curious,
I’m a bearish investor but a hyper aggressive trader that follows the market short term action. The meme about bears on WSB is funny but ppl need to realize it’s just a joke. One of the benefits traders have over passive investors is the ability to make money on the downside too. 

If the bears are right about a potential crash or at least a correction, WSB can capitalize on the situation. At the very least hedge your calls/longs. When the indicators turn this ridiculously negative all bets are on the table. When the indicators flip back to positive then go bullish. 

Use your power of flexibility WSB!,
Congrats about time it was bear season,
You had $700 in your account? 

Did you just start investing, did you blow it up, or is this a side account?,
I know you're not supposed to ask educational questions on WSB.  But can someone explain what happens with a put if you hold to expiration?  I bought 1 Put once and had no idea what I was doing, when it went up, I sold it but what if I held it to the end? how do you make money with it?,
Damn it feels good to be a 🌈 🐻,
You beautiful bear,
Teach me your ways,

Like I have any money left,
👀 the dip is looking like a solid buying opportunity,
Missing comma strikes again dip pussy.,
Over his testimony the last two days, this is like exactly what he did not say.,
I feel like JP is the only person who knows when to buy the dip because he's the one who makes the dip dip and the peaks peak. It's almost like the entire system might just be... Unfair.,
Ive seen this movie too many times, it dips and people buy.  Then it keeps dipping and people sell their calls for a loss and buy puts.  Then it rips up for the next 3 months.  Rinse, repeat,
Which dip?,
Glad I’ve got a nice stash of cash buried ...   fuck you Powell and all your Washington family !,
I'm quite the dip pussy hound myself,
52W Low is my favorite entry

LEV-GENI-BEEM-JMIA-OPEN-ARVL-UBER-GRPN,
Money printer goes brrrrrrrr!,
Dip dip take a sip,
Glad a memer is using the proper font.  Good job OP.,
Got perfect “cup the balls” form right there. He’s jiggled an economy or two before I see.,
How many deaths am I supposed to buy? I bought 17 of them so far.,
printer goes brrrrrrr,

Oversold?worst case is priced in. Bounce back ahead!!,
Fffffuuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkkk,
About 10 time greener than yesterday when market close, I want buy call on TSLA, but can’t afford it. Down 40% in past 30 days. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),

Buy more, you're doing great.,
Go into a medically induced coma for about a decade then check back. Probably wont be any better but I bet you could use the rest.,
You need to increase your position,
Its not real until you‘ve sold. 🚀,
Sell your wife,
#buy a slightly used dildo from WISH,
Hold BB for inevitable mooning and for clov you'll need to pray.,
Buy during the omicron crash,
Next time buy call options... normally they expire worthless much quicker!,
Man, just invest in solid companies instead of chasing quick gains. There are so many solid cash cows to pick from that will do well.,
Wait for these to go to 0 so you can average down and reduce the cost basis.,
it's only a loss if you sell 🦍,
Put your stop loss closer to your entry price, you should never be able to go in 50%-

I personally do 5% on entries and as soon as im in green i move it to my entry price incase a green trade goes red.

However it is up to you how you want to lose your savings,
Do cover calls and use the premiums to average down.,
Sell covered calls?,
It's always darkest before dawn. Buy the dip.,
Don't health plans report their largest revenue streams from Jan-March? Enrollment season is oct-december... 

Large costs going out for marketing and labor around oct-dec. Jan 1 they begin reaping payments from those enrollments. 

I would expect CLOV to dip this time of year and start increasing toward a Feb-March or April peak, depending on when they report full last year/Q1.

Same with Ehealth, Multiplan, Go Health etc. 

I think average down.

*edit* Also Blackberry I have no idea; I have one share I got for free.,
Sell and start over. That money is better spent making money than waiting around.,
next time you're in the money, sell, and don't buy back until a week like this week when everything seems too cheap to not buy,
Double down,
Can you buy $HOOD next, please?,
Set a GTC sell order you are okay with and delete the app. Meme stocks giveth but they def also taketh,
These red numbers there are not big enough, you have not won the game yet,
I feel like your bb bags have better chances of recovering than your clov ones.,
Double up,
Top Ramen and lotion!,
Yolo all your money on 12/6 SPY 450 calls.,
Stop buying trash meme stocks,
Wrote covered calls,
Inverse yourself,
BB and CLOV man you asked for it.,
Its too late to sell. I'm in the same boat - so we can hold together![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream),
With this track record, perhaps shorting tsla is right up your alley,
My only advice is to blackout clov when it gets to sub 1.5billion MC otherwise your posts will get deleted.,
Don’t buy garbage.  That being said, I do it all the time and can’t be trusted to give advice.,

Just watched the video. It was awesome. Fat Elon Musk knows his shit.,
RKLB is definitely one of my favorite long term holds. Feels like unless you keep up with space news that stay under the radar.,
Holy shit. I already have RKLB shares but I think I'll buy more today. They have a lot of work to do to turn that animation into a functioning system, but if they do it will be SpaceX's first real competition. I like the ambition.,

I wish I was dead,
It's amazing to me that the slide hasn't stopped. A lot of people caught a falling knife on this one over the last few months.,
Make wish great again , please. 🙏📈,
Dog you good? Your chart looks like satans dick,
Total return -69%. Nice.,
Same happened to me. But thankfully only a handful of shares.,
I wish the company goes to $0,
Looks like my "T" Atnt holdings.,
Nice now show your 70.14% SDC.,
Bro just please cut your losses..,
Don't drop below $2,
Nice,
Gah,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
Wish will come back. When? In one year, if no one expects, soon if everybody talks.,
Never understood why it would go up. Who uses that crap??,

Prepare for battle,
Nah tomorrow flat. Friday green.,
At least my robinhood icon stays green I just won’t open it,
Lmao these nuts,
That's what they said yesterday,
I hope you douse yourself in oil, burst into flames, and toss yourself off a cliff.,
I think the theme of early day rallies and latter day drops will continue.,
Leaving my account untouched for the rest of the year.,
How do you do the remind me thing? 😂,
1) Don't trade on hope guys - a lot of comments were pure hopium

2) In a bear market, don't think about protecting your profits (if they exist), protect your capital. 

Positions going into today: 95% invested (RBLX 126 P 12/03 X 40 & RBLX 118P 12/03 x 15), long term equity holds on SPY, AAPL, AMD. 

Positions end of day: All Cash

Best of luck trading these choppy waters guys,
Tomorrow until Christmas green,
FLEE FLEE WITH YOUR TENDIES!!!,
Green, only if you’re color blind.,
I bought 200 27p January 2022 puts on Vix surely it will go down right?,
🦘🦘🦘,
The whole market can fuck off tomorrow as long as AMD goes up 🙂,
Who's going to be the Gandalf in this?,

RIP to your money and your marriage.,
Your marriage summed up in a portfolio,
She can have 50% of the losses!,
She cant take money if you have none. Give this man a genius grant.,
This is not what they meant when they said money over bitches bro,
Holla ‘we want prenup!’,
So instead of losing 50% in your divorce, you are losing 90%.,
Bad idea…good luck.,
You're now divorced AND BROKE,
Her attorneys figure that out they will file motion after motion to seize your assets, including paychecks and bank/brokerage accounts.,
Can’t imagine why she wants a divorce,
Her boyfriend will appreciate this.,
She can’t take it if you lose it first, right?,
Gambling can come out of your side of the settlement.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Cash $29.39, still got some leverage there,
Hope your divorce goes well. Hope you get to see your kiddos grow up. Hope you’re staying sober. There is always tomorrow. But, don’t fuck up tomorrow with your choices today.,
#now I see why she's leaving you for the pool boy,
You don’t realize how screwed you are.,
Lmao bet you wish you did a 50/50 now,
Mooooore!,
W for the divorce, L for filio.,
Why mess with options on an IPO stock with no revenue when you could use options on an index etf? 

Sorry…disregard…forget where I was for a second.,
Next level petty.,
her bf is going to give you a spanking,
1000p on TSLA for tomorrow?  yikes

maybe the 45 on LCID is gonna go better.,
😂 marriage is like another way of making money for woman nowadays. Hope you learned your lesson man . Enjoy your life .,
You’re a bloody moron,
Cheaper to keep her,
Should've kept your marriage.,
No wonder she left you if you have a history of making decisions like this...,
She is still going to get half dude be careful,
🤣 that’s awesome!!,
You came here looking for likes but this shit is pathetic. I can understand why she's leaving.,
i can see why she's leaving,
YOLO!,
I believe in you🥳,
Plot twist: you’ll earn millions of dollars and your cheating wife will become a millionaire,
Fuck that fucking cunt! Me too!!!,
UR almost back to zero.  So U letting us know there is hope!

, B uh Man an Fix it!


edit: children?,
Did you throw in the towel with Tesla?,
Sir, you could have easily given me that money and I would have returned it to you after the divorce is finalized. Of course that would be at 50 sons on the dollar. :),
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,
You’re still down 1k, this isn’t loss porn or gain porn… come back when you’re at 50k or at $0,
Can’t lose half if you already lost half pointsathead.gif,
If your expiry were a little more down the road… say January, you would be printing like Powell.,
You broke she up.,
Meet Kevin portfolio -3X leverage,
Bad plan.

Making any major moves with your money while going through a divorce is a great way to get your assets and wages seized once her attorneys catch on to what you're doing.,
Your doing a great job! Keep it up.

Sincerely 

Joe Biden,
Tesla put??? You should've just taken cash out of the bank and set it on fire. Would've been quicker.,
So you went ahead and exacerbated your situation, huh,
Nice job. Now you’ve made two bad investments 👏,
Good news is, these stocks are fucking you more than she ever did.,
I’d buy puts on marriage but I know damn well she doesn’t go down.,
Holding LCID to the moon as well, down today but will be right back up tomorrow, easy money if you buy low today and sell high tomorrow.,
Edit: Everyone here think the first pic is my current status? Na son second pic the status. And for those who don’t know we split about two months back after i suffered a bad yolo loss and so since she left when we were almost broke she only get half of that amount! Ha! Been up over 69k and full of 20yr old pussy since she left!

Edit: down votes on this will equal 2 months of itchy butt hole,
You dumb tard brains….,
Atleast you be taxed on your unrealized capital gains,
Absolute legend,

Tesla puts? You wear velcro shoes, don't you?,
a quote i've heard

 "TSLA, where shorts go to die",
I hope you make money OP, but I decided a long time ago to never try shorting TSLA. I like my asshole how it is.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Yes,
Man you are screwed,
11K and yolo? 🤣,
I'd be so scared...,
Good luck with this EXTREMELY bad idea,
This dude literally just made 15k off shorting Tesla,
Beter to put it in blackberry,

Wow I respect you going for this considering the losses WISH has consistently delivered. I saw people Yolo at $7, $6, $5, each time thinking it hit bottom and got destroyed. Good luck balls of steel.,
Bro you see how it’s worked out for everyone else and you’re like “fuck it I’ll give it a go too”,
Make wish great again,
At this point I just WISH hits $12 next year with Jackie as CEO,
Keep buying. You will be right one day.,
Filter by loss and every post you see is WISH. And you still decided to invest into it...,
Crap stock,
Wish's website is not just difficult, but discouraging.  One has to click many times to see what the actual price of any one item is.  It's a PITA. And that's the kiss of death for an internet retailer, to make it difficult to click and buy.,
The comical thing is that you’re lecturing other people like you know what you’re doing: https://reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/r6o2r6/stop_buying_shit_ass_companies_with_no_revenue/,

Only thing that could stop the Brrrrr is Lrrrrrr from Omicron,
Don’t even talk to me about that judas.

i don't think this meme timing is very good, the market is bleeding today,
who has say how much dollars  are printed and is there a reason why they are printing that much? does us and a have budget deficit so high that you need to print billions to cover it?,
' Dem puts printing today though! Lol,
Not so fast…,
putt on $PELOSI

This is my worst trading day since yesterday,
Hypothetically, is it insider trading if I load up on a bunch of SPY puts, visit the New York Stock Exchange while I know I have the Omicron variant, and pass out in public?,
!banbet spy 500 2d 

Get me out of this sub lol.,
#Ban Bet Won

/u/LlamaLlamaRedPajamaz (1/0) made a bet that SPY would go to 450.2 when it was 459.39 and it did, congrats fucker.,
2018:  Cars lose half their value as soon as you drive off the lot.   Stocks only go up. 

2021: Stocks lose half their value as soon as I buy them.  Used cars sell at new prices.,
when i blew up my account for the third time a month ago with SPY contracts , i told myself i was gonna take a long break and stick to swing trading shares. 

Well my four year relationship ended about a week ago and jerking off gives me limited euphoria so guess who’s back at the casino 😎 back to SPY calls and shitposting on the daily,
We saw a 14 point change in SPY in 1 day. Very healthy very cool,
Well...

I need to find $12,000 by Friday to buy these 457p back,
So for all the people who said they wished they started trading when covid crashed the markets in 2019 because they would have timed the dip and went all in at the bottom… let’s see you time the bottom this time…,
We are likely to see a short-term rally in the next week or so, but I'm probably going to offload a lot of positions into any sort of rally.

The biggest problem right now is just that the "smart money" is unloading at an unprecedented rate.  You have hedge funds reducing leverage substantially, insiders selling at an abnormal rate (some of it is tax considerations, but it's still big numbers), and it feels like retail is going to keep getting caught on the wrong side of these trades: see small caps/high growth the past month where everyone piled into those in late September/October expecting a small cap rally.

Retail is currently all piling into the 5-10 mega cap lifeboats, but if we see heavy selling there, could see a quick 5-7% plunge on everything in late December.

I think we're seeing a late 2018 redux but on a quicker timeline (think 6 weeks instead of 12 weeks).

It's just worth considering being a bit defensive the next couple of weeks because we're seeing extreme bearish sentiment while mega caps are still near (or even at in the case of AAPL) all time highs.

Of course, the counter to all of this is that most of the "negatives" are starting to be baked into the cake: first case of Omicron in the US, dramatically faster tapering being priced into bond yields, etc.

But I just feel as if we're seeing mega caps repeat what we saw happen to small caps in October..., why would that end differently?

If you're going to go long here, give the position time to breathe, might have to look to late January calls or beyond to at least prevent yourself from getting caught.,
Some of you have never lost 25K in a day before and it shows,
Just found out my wife is pregnant.


I'm gonna be a step dad 😀,
My stonks are RED 📈

My balls are BLUE 🔵

At least when stores run out of toilet paper in the next few days, I have these $PLTR shares to wipe my ass with.,
Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.

Source: am bug,
If your still here and not wiped out yet, congratulations: we will now be entering the next stage,
Is this the Christmas Rally?,
VIX is entering legit crash territory today. If it spikes again tomorrow we are not gonna have a good Christmas.,
We could gap up 3% tomorrow and I’d still be convinced we’ll end the day red.,
Tomorrow is either red or green. Thank me later,

Lost 35k this week and got flagged as day trader. U win some boys but lose most.,
Had 80k put guy not been such a pussy he’d be looking at 150k in his account right now.,
Roommate came to my room, said he heard a bunch of people applauding. But it was just me getting my cheeks clapped  👏,
My wife is going to leave me,
Lost $10k last year. Recovered all and got $8k on top of it this year, only to lose $20k this year. The fuck,
Sold a spy put for $83 dollars today that ended up being worth $711 at close, fml 🤦‍♀️,
I buy calls ... stock crashes.  I buy puts..stocks fkn skyrocket.   I fkn give up.,
It use to be "buy calls on this dip."

now everyone by like "buy puts on this rally",
wait a min, I slept at 1pm today and i just woke up.  SPY was up 1.6 %, but now i am bankrupted .

WTF,
Honestly think this market has ruined me. Financially and mentally. Have been doing this full time two years. Last year was great, now I’m legit red for the year. I had many chances too but nope just kept holding my calls too long or selling the gold ones too fucking early. Wow this hurts. I feel so unmotivated. I’m a loser,
Zillow used to send me monthly updates on zestimate of my house but they didn't this month. They must be embarrassed.,
cant believe we were making fun of bears just this morning,
Build a bear being up 27 % today is surely a sign right? 😂,
I deposited 3 grand on monday, its gone today lmao,
Who else lost 5(+)% today? 🩸

🖐,
+75k at open to -180k at close,
I think I was happier back in prison.,
Bought a new dog bed for my dog and he started vigorously humping it then started puking his brains out while he continued humping the shit out of it. VERY bullish sign for SPY tomorrow,

The air feels different when everything is crashing and you have puts. This must be how gay feels. I like it c:,
This market is total bullshit , I’m out,
I’m utterly wrecked by the last 3 weeks. I don’t know what to do now.,
Tomorrow: a second case of the virus was found in America. Stonks dump another -4%.,
###### PRO TIP

**People spamming “Pro tip” are professional penis fondlers**,
I pretty much need a 5% gain on SPY by next Friday, or I'm probably never going to be able to have the money to trade again.  


Which, y'know, may be a blessing. Just give up my dreams of riches and accept that my retirement plan really is just a bottle of liquor and a tall building.,
Green futures. Fooled me once, shame on you. Fool me 29 times, shame on me.,
Damn everyone in here saying puts are the new calls, means my puts are fucked 😔,
Feeling cute. May blow up my account tomorrow, idk.,
Someone on Twitter posted a screenshot saying circus clowns make $67k/ year on avg and then tagged Jim Cramer and asked if it was true lmfao,

Bers I hope u have a fragmented sleep pattern that leads you to be slightly more tired than usual tomorrow, but not exhausted enough to make any life/career altering mistakes or decisions, just enough to reconsider your poor economic opinions.,
had a friend recently get into options trading. He said he was up 20% on a call but he had to let it expire because he didn’t know how to sell it. 

I’ve never laughed so fucking hard,
Amc is a cult,
mods, if 50k put guy tries to come back and post gain porn, please ban him immediately. bitch ass mofo deleting his post when it goes down.,
Today was a perfect example of why futures don’t matter. You can be up 2% at open and close 2% down. Literally no point in watching futures all night.,
You know there is **at least one retard here** that did these moves in the last 5 trading days:  
  
1. Bought calls last Wednesday (Front running Santa rally)  
2. Switched to puts last Friday (Omicron fears)  
3. Switched to calls on Monday (Omicron being a nothingburger)  
4. Switched to puts yesterday (Jpow inflation comments)  
5. Switched to calls this morning (Seeing the Futures rally)  
6. Switched to puts at close today (first Omicron case in the US)  
  
Show up, because you deserved to be a mod here!,
This is actually like, worse than September LOL,
buddy of mine was up like 40% this year on 9K principle doing his gambling stock theta plays (selling CCs and cash secured puts) and is now down like 5% for the year.

He basically went from a 12K account to 8K just on shares. Yikes.,

I asked my wife if we could have sex tonight. She said the only thing I’m fucking is stupid,
I'm making so much money in this market, is something I wish I could say.,
Omicron is priced in, Fed hikes are priced in, future covid variants are priced in but something which isn’t priced in is the OnlyFans IPO next year,
2k going into spy calls at open tomorrow. Wish me luck,
Older I get, the more I also realize that having a life filled with meaningful friendships and relationships is a lot more important than having tons of money. I do well financially for my age, but it has come at the sacrifice of all the other stuff. At the point now where I've kind of given up on having any meaningful relationships, so I just chase a bigger bag, but damn, I feel empty.,
So it turns out, I'm over leveraged AF.,

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) wasnt spy up 2%? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) why did everything get clapped? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Futures will be extremely green. But they don’t mean shit so get ready for another bloodbath tomorrow,
If you ever feel bad just remember that cathie wood is more retarded than any of us,

Fucking depressed right now,
This is the dip I’ve been hoping for… I just wish I had the amount of money I had when I was hoping for it 😂,
The year is 2420. SPY has been ripping back and forth between 450 and 465 every day for like 400 years. You wake up, put your helmet on, and plug yourself into the Robinhood(TM) metaverse for another day of alternating between panic selling and euphoria.  You haven't left your pod in months. What a rush. 

SPY opens at 450 and immediately starts blasting green dildos. You take a long slurp of soy-product through your feeding tube and turn your extra small fleshlight to "maximum-stim." You were born for this shit. Today's gonna be a great day.,

If we are entering a bear market you can expect giant swings in both directions, that's just bear market nature. If we aren't in a bear market, and just a 5% S&P pullback (13% IWM), then we hit that today. Whatever way you look at it, don't be surprised to see a massive green day tomorrow or friday,

It’s okay to be bear on this POS,

this is no longer fun,
My losses are only transitory,
We need  - and will soon get - some positive news regarding omicron to resume the bull run.,

You mean to tell me that a bunch of analysts knew inflation wasn't transitory before the federal reserve? 

Doubt. 

They've known all along and their front man was flat out lying 🤥,
Got gapped so hard you can yell guh and hear echoes,
If the government tells you not to panic are they really saying OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKK,

Damn there is more joy in funeral than this thread today. Relax guys, we are less than 5% off ATH.,
stock market crashes. average american unaffected.,
Omnicron is so fake and 🌈,
Today's drop had nothing to do with the virus. Even Zoom dumped 6% which is literally the virus stock.,
Sometimes the best trades are the ones you don't make,
Fuck this market. Just got to the oyster bar and gonna drown my sorrows in dirty gin martinis.,
So my gains were transitory,
Ever since I got my permaban reversed, the market has been blood red,
Guess my puts are fucked,

You guys are right here right now. You could be anywhere in the world doing anything you want, but you are on WSB reading this comment. Let that sink in.,

Market suck my big fat donkey dick,
Just a friendly reminder futures were green yesterday morning too.  Don’t rub your chubs too soon.  Also futures are and always have been fake and gay,
Up 25%, took a nap.

Woke up, down 7%.

Wtf happened. 🥵🤣,
Due to poor financial decisions I am now selling artisanal blowjobs, $20 each. Who would like one?,
Having shares in this market is like being in a cozy warm house in the middle of a storm, knowing that if you stay inside you’ll be fine. Having calls is like being in that same storm in a run away car with a methed up raccoon from Florida at the drivers seat repeatedly dry humping the wheel.,
i've been kinda in shock for the past for hours, i've wiped 40% of my life savings in the past month, can't say it wasn't a possibility, but just the speed of it..,

I honestly have not the single guess what is going to happen tomorrow. This is fucking riveting AF though,
Wait last I checked SPY was at +$8 for the day WHAT ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Folks, what you are witnessing is controlled demolition of the stock market. They are slowly taking the air out of the bubble,
Remember last year how ppl here were saying pltr would 5x in 5 years? Well... now you have 4 years ⏳,
To go from +200% to likely -100% on my Snow puts is a heartbreaker.,
WHO HELD THEIR SPY CALLS EXPIRING TODAY AND GOT FKED,
jpow timed his "inflation isnt transitory and we can accelerate the QE taper by a few months" talk right at the same time as omnicron so that we can all blame the virus over markets dropping

the shift bastard,
Ok, new investment strategy idea: marry a rich cougar.,
I bought spy POOTS today and they worked ! Up 200% and holding overnight cuz I’m poor. fuck me,
From 200->1k->160 help,
warms my heart seeing how many "long term investors" were newly minted today.,
When you buy the dip but it keeps dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
Boss. I was just joking. I don’t make more at my side gig. No need for a raise but please remove the help wanted sign.,
please god let spy go back to 468 before my nose runs out of candy,
Thank god for DWAC... i'm up $5 AH... makes my $9k loss feel better,
I wish I could just delete my brokerage apps and forget about everything but I can't go 1 day without staring at them,

No hits to the balls tho,
What nonsensical bullish thesis will bulls come up with tonight? Stay tuned to find out,
My moves tomorrow will include a swift 6’ drop,
Incoming dead cat bounce. We're all here for it.,
Is everybody fearful yet? I heard that's the best time to buy or something.,
I’m not even holding calls and I lost 10% of my actual portfolio today OUCH,
Man fuck the stock market. Was up 3k this morning ended 2k down,
Futures green, I seen this movie before,
[deleted],
March 2020 again? Let’s have that 8% hulk dick day followed by a 10% rug pull 🚀🚀🔥🔥,
100k gme gains down to 50k in March... Finally back to 100k. I don't have to tell my wifes boyfriend I lost 50k gains yesss.,
I don't want to do this anymore,
You ever just get depressed?,
How do y’all get past the feeling of it being the end of the day when it gets dark at 5pm,
If you have short term calls you fukd. Limit down tomorrow. VIX to 40 by Friday,
Omicron EV coming soon spy calls at open,
Yeah $452 is nice and all but I bought $463 and $467 calls for Friday sooooooooooo,
Kinda funny how axeman been spamming about his dumbass SPY 500c for the past month. Today he's using bond yields as his copium, what's it gonna be tomorrow,
Hold me and tell me it’s all fake,
Everybody mad that we ended red like there wasn’t a 2% gap up to make money before hand….idgaf if we end red tomorrow 

#HOE WE TRADE WEEKLIES,
Regretting that I didnt pull the trigger on the 100 SPY puts I had queued up. Would have been up $60,000 at the end of the day...,
The only moves im making tomorrow are with my bowels. Its gonna be like a girthy cookie dough rope, i can feel it,
Can I offer you a nice egg in these trying times?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
I’m still bullish…. on VIX,
When did the printer turn into a vacuum???,
I like volatility, upward volatility.   Not this shit,
#Pro tip


Lose weight in no time by eating once a week.,
We're all getting one year subscriptions to a Jelly of the Month club for Christmas

I'm stoked, I love jelly,
We are in a ManBearPig Market. Total carnage today.,
Futures mattering nicely rn,
Before I get banned, I just wanna say


These hoes for da streets,
The market is so fucking rigged. Didn’t someone sell like $10 billion worth of AAPL yesterday? 

We can never win this game.,
~1.5k in spy and Nvda calls turned into 10k last month. Back to 0 now,
I swear to God, if this is another futes fake out I’m going to…..I’m going to…..well im going to be very angry,
Some of you guys really do be shilling with zero imagination.

Tell me a story. Paint me a picture. spy calls. Bring me to your happy place and let me in. that ass.

I mean really, if you want to sell something. Fucking sell it with conviction.

I want to Kiss Ryan Gosling,
In the last 2 weeks I've lost all my gains during the epic rally starting back in October which had saved all of my losses from the September pullback. Back to square 1 basically. Spent so much time trying to improve my strategies and risk management yet I'm back where I started somehow,
These Dec SPY calls are feelin heavy bros,
Imagine looking at the state of this market with speculative growth companies being given 50B+ market caps every other month like candy and thinking "ugh this bear stuff just makes no sense!",
I’m gonna buy something tomorrow even if it’s fucking wrong 🤡,
I see green dildos es futures but I have PTSD,
Guys, if the worst should happen and you lose everything, just remember that your wife’s boyfriend is now dating a chick that will get zero money from her divorce.,
Anyone else’s Spotify year review thing just make you embarrassed af at the shit you listen to,
We are all winners here:

❌If we save, we lose 10%

✅If we play, we might win 10%

✅If we win, we keep ~75%

✅If we lose, we write it off,
not falling for this shit again.,
Don’t worry tomorrow is for sure green,
FB casually going below 300 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Puts on corona, omicron is the best variant, more infectious, pushing the more lethal variants away 
    
Also puts on my financial future,
Fucking clown market,
We are fucked aren’t we,
If you sold today, punch yourself in the face,
Absolutely destroyed. Margin called. Gonna take a break over Christmas :(,
I’m literally never going to financially recover from this.,
Fuk,
I'd like a refund please,
Bought a couple spy 463 puts for $0.8 and sold for $1.23 🥴,
[deleted],
Me: I’m tired of losing money! 

Market: Well that’s too damn bad!,
Goddamn I never take profits,
Well that was fucking BAD. 

Have we seen a sell-off that bad since the pandemic started? Maybe September 3rd 2020. Any other time since? 

What are the bullish arguments at this point? Considering that Omicron is probably just a catalyst and not the driving force behind the sell off...,
80% of the stocks were in bear market anyways. Now the remaining 20% will join them.,
Guys, Friday was puts, Monday was Calls, Tuesday was puts, Today was Calls, then puts, so tomorrow will be puts then calls.

How are you guys not rich?,
This week is really good, I’m already up -270% of all time,
Opened up 77k worth of SPX puts on 11/1 for Dec 17 and watched it theta decay slowly for a month, finally exited with 50% gains today, got 150k in cash gang,
If that was a bull trap then it was beautifully done,
Just watched the selling pressure blow through a 4.5 million dollar buy order on SPY 👀,
VIX at 31 is spooky af,
Not to be outdone, Roblox changes name to Rotesseract,
It’s okay gentlemen, ill save the market by buying puts at open. You are welcome,
I’m down fucking 15 percent,
my trading account is transitory

RIP,
Lol why is spy not dead,
I feel like im on the Titanic with these SPY leaps,
Fuckin 4K loss in 4 days pretty much all of it, I been sleeping in,
Cramer says smart stuff, but isn't smart. 

A real Precambrian Mongoloid,
My spy calls expire friday. Friday is national make a gift day. I feel like I’m gonna end up gifting MMs my money,
Deposited some more cash to buy the rug pull again tomorrow,
Serious question - what is the catalyst bulls expect for SPY going back to ATH say any timeframe longer than a month? 

We already heard the truth from the fed. Tapering schedule is moving up which means rate hikes will be moved up ahead of schedule as well. Inflation must be combated. 

The Omnicron variant is nothing more than the current scapegoat to create bag holders as they run for the exit in the coming months.,
Tomorrow is the day Enron went tits up.. shares went from like $90 to 0.26,
I'm not just in a recession, I'm in a depression,
Up 1,250% on spy puts time to get some calls,
Pro tip: if robinhood says you're going to be PDT banned if do the next day trade, go wild!! you have all session before it kicks in the next trading day.,
Volatility makes me feel alive,
Fuck. Just got my first margin call and it was for $12.12.  lame,
No deaths from omicron recorded, except for our portfolios,
BREAKING NEWS: Inflation isn't transitory,
This too shall pass.,
how the fuck can you guys stand watching cable news for more than 15 seconds?,
Please mr market, I have a family.,
All I've ever wanted in life is money, drugs, whores, and solitude, and I've never been allowed to have them.

When the fuck do I actually get to win?,
Yesterday was high af on shrooms and found myself being attracted to my reflection in the mirror, and then I had to check if I was male or female, and was relieved to find a dick in my pants, but at the same time, it left me wondering about something: does this whole scenario make me a bear?,
I’ll be damned if we break 200D. This is definitely a correction. It is unrelated to virus or any other BS reasons being claimed by the media. It’s nothing more than a healthy 5-7% correction.

Not a financial advice, I’m retarded.,
Do bears nut to omicron news??,
Usually I like to buy at the top.  But sometimes I sell at the bottom just to switch it up.,
It doesnt matter what Futes are.....It doesnt matter what the Market opens and closes tomorrow....Either way....My accts are gonna get violated, wrecked, and fuked PrivateSociety style,
BABA LEAPS are the road to being homeless,
I’m ready for circuit breakers.,
Want to eat edibles and go to the aquarium?,
finally, the long-awaited rug pull will be tomorrow, or some other time, or maybe never, but what’s important is that it will be, unless it won’t be,
in my free time I like to shred pieces of paper and put them back together. it’s like a free puzzle,
Most of you probably don't remember March 2020 because you were still finishing middle school. But, to paint a picture of what is possible, the market did limit up on futures during the crash.,

Brother!,
No worries you have Tesla to cover,
Make sure to round up the 622 to 700 so you can buy more covered calls :),
I’m still holding my shares brother !! Down the same !!,
ProTip:  If you sell now, you can get a nice juicy tax beak.,
Diversification is what killed you.,
Greetings, brethren.,
at least ur half smart,
Count your lucky stars you have those Tesla shares.,
Tard you are.

At least it's shares.,
Tight balancing act 👏👏👏,
$12.19 $CLOV 🍀 holder here.,
I bought more today.  Our day will come 👀![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
CLOV to da moon,
Idk why but I got a massive boner from seeing that clov loss porn,
Chamath thanks you for the kind donation.,
I'm only -40% on clov stocks, so now I hold for years hoping it returns to at least 8$,
It's an insult to TSLA having that crap next to it,

Realize that shit,
Nice, I turned 3$ to 4$ today,
I turned 10k to 600,
You couldn't even buy any of those options for $600...much less all 3.,
Today was a PUT day.  To bad I thought the US economy would withstand fake news.  The market went on a fire sale today.   

Good job! Hope it lasts for you.,
What inspired you to buy puts?,
Excellent work homo! (as in homosapien),
We'll follow your career with great interest.

Looking forward to your "10k to $5" post.,
I read the title as 600k to 10k and didn't even wince. That would've been more normal than whatever is "Gain" thing is,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
enjoy it while it lasts, won't be long,
Nice! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Couldn’t stop laughing out loud when I saw Tesla put being profitable. What are the odds.,
Damn I did that but reverse,
Hey someone explain to me how i can get into this too.  Im not a complete idiot ive been in stocks for a long time but never day trade or options.   How tf are yall doing this?  And often are you taking losses lol,
how the f,

“I have a gambling addiction. Rather than acknowledge this and call it quits I have decided to double down, now I can lose even more!”,
Interesting,  looking at the daily chart this is no support level for this stock.

&#x200B;

If the market keeps taking a big fat turd tomorrow, perhaps a couple weekly puts are in order here :),
How does someone so whacked have any money,
I $WISH u ape good luck,
I love this massive gai ns post where it shows -23k,
!RemindMe 50 years,
Atta kid. I only have 3,000 shares but I’m not selling. I’m down 19k and don’t give a fuck. Shit will print eventually.,
Avg cost basis?,
This thing has not even begun,
 Or a massive loss porn,
IM AT 9557 SHARES @ 7.28,
To the moon brother!  I also bought more today.,
Either way you'll be famous here.,
The balls on some of you guys… it’s literally a market crash,
Why bet it all on a Chamath pump & dump? Why not on a real company like Tesla or Apple? Good luck though.,
I would say good luck, but you don't deserve it. Congrats on being retarded.,
Well, as long as you average down far enough.. at some point an 8-cent opening bell fart will yield you 100-grand.  Not impressive.,
Guh,
I bought more again today...average nearly in the $6s now.,
So, this is an absolutely insane post. But, I feel like you actualy have a pretty good average. Good luck on this one broskie.,
I agree that you will have crazy gains to post- but I’m at at much higher cost basis and will still be holding bags when you do.,
Why?,
The gains are from the people on the other side of the trade.,
I came to say I hate clov. That is all,
Buying more when it dips because it's a hype business?

For you my friend, the night is darkest just before pitch fucking black,

Why would you buy that garbage fire?,
Hood has hit a new all time low every day for the last month it seems... why in the world would you buy it lol,
Sorry sir, nonrefundable. I hate margin purchases, won't do it.,
Odd purchase! Hope it turns out but that’s a barrel fire,
Write a strongly worded email to Vlad.,
One thing i always forget to do when i sell to jump into another yolo starting on monday is to DCA throughout the week when in a bear market. So i tell you this, Start to DCA rather than go all in immediately.

edit: this means buy a little today, buy a little tomorrow and so on. You can catch the bottom more accurately, whilst also not missing a low cost average if it does start going up.,
Since your phones jailbroken I may just login,
Hold it. Not going anywhere. Don’t listen to WSB. I know they hate HOOD. Can be easily acquired by the bigger brokerage.,
I have no sympathy for you,
Sell covered calls my friend. There is some juicy premiums.

edit: You can sell 60 covered calls at 29.5 strike a month out and get $6K in premiums right now.

Edit 2: I have 1.25K shares at 44.5 average. Selling covered calls (strike below average) and averaging down with more shares.,
No, something about it being outside their refund collar,
Wrong number, who dis?,
Should've bought $AMC and a Spiderman preorder to get a nifty little NFT.,

Omg 😲 you're completely insane,
The IRS hates this one weird trick.,
buy high and sell low, name a better combination,
Poor choice on stocks. Even worse choice on execution.,
Baba Targets $240,
Watch it go up hard tomorrow, you paper handed pussy

Altho, still fuck Chinese stocks,
Why not sell cc while you had them,
RIP,
Make a $WISH on Ali $BABA,
That's what you get for investing in East Taiwan. Shoulda invested in the real thing and gone all in on TSM.,
That's like a lot of money,
This rich motherfucker was just realizing the loss for taxes,
probably would have been better to not open your account for 2 - 3 years than realizing that loss,
Lmao. Remind me in 5 years when BABA goes to 500.,
Dont check the price in March lol.,
Click “help” in the top left corner,
This is real porn,
Sorry bro. Sucks.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
3 WSB rules.
1. Buy high and sell low at 50-90% loss
2. Diamond hands and never sell.
3. Don't forget above 2 rules.,
F,
Beautiful,
Guh,
Dang this is a sign baba reversal soon,
Jack Ma was the main reason to invest in Baba.  He's been ghosted and there's no coming back.  Some kind of money laundering charge will be made up and Baba will go full commie.  Not soon, but as things get worse in China it will happen.,
Thank god someone is losing more money than me.. like way, way more… tons of money. Congrats!,
I personally buy puts on almost any Chinese stock either when the company speaks ill of the government or the CCP starts to regulate a industry. People don't seem to understand that the CCP will let an industry burn on a bad decision they made rather than admit wrong doing. I've not lost a single dime betting on baba falling.,
This has nothing to do with paper hands.

Buying Chinese stocks was just retarded,
Booooooo!!!,
My oh my,
Very Smart. Now you don't have to pay taxes your entire life!,
Paper Handed Bitch,
This loss will let you deduct the maximum $3000 from you taxes for the next 100 years!

Well done!,
Jesus,
It is good to cut loss, imagine it goes to $50,
Thank you for your service. Rally tomorrow confirmed.,
Ba bye,
That’s some fine loss porn.,
Uncle Xi got you good.,
F,
That was a bad idea. You would have been fine 3 years down the road,
China is doing this little thing called "Common Prosperity". It's difficult to invest in a country where the government could ask for large sums of ~~protection money~~ donations every once in a while.,
You better be tax loss harvesting because thats some serious sell low action.,

In RuneScape I used to make a female character and pretend to be a girl and make people “pay me to be their Gf” lmao… my bitch avatar used to make bank and I traded it all to My real account… I basically pimped myself out on RuneScape when I was like 10 years old… I will do it in the metaverse too lmao,
Wasn’t there a tv show about this, and the dude was fucking his best friend in the AR. Seems fun.,
Make sure you know how to use the 3 sea shells,
Why the fuck would I send 12k in Eth to some guy on telegram to get an early access pass to the metaverse if it didn’t have sex?,
And I’m getting screwed if it does allow sex.,
Everyone keeps talking about facebook, when the real winner of the metaverse is going to be pornhub!,
Demolition Man 2.0,
WSB meta verse bukkake party

Gordon Johnson in the center,
Many of you will finally loose virginity,
A ton of virgins are finally going to get laid.,
Facebook beat myspace because of the relationship status so I assume they factored in sex. A lot of sex.,
but there is already VR porn and VR cam girls.. or so I am told :) :),
Whatever happens in the metaverse stays in the metaverse!,
then it's actually not screwed... forget my being.,
Yep.  Any technology like that needs porn industry to be there.  That determined bluray vs hd video, betamax vs vcr etc.,
They allow Sweet Baby Rays,
Who wants to fuck in Facebook?

No thanks. 

Hard pass.,
Fuck Facebook and Fuck Zuckerberg.

I refuse to touch Meta since that fucking company is the antithesis of what a free and open net should be, and now they want to control the metaverse? Get fucked.,
I won't be on meta regardless,

Sex sells.

And do not tell me I say something your wifes boyfriend does not know. Or your wife.,
I mean people are already having sex on VR-Chat, I don't see why we would need Facebook's knock off.,
it’s gonna be difficult bc Zuck doesn’t know how to code sexy time. His wife’s bf was commissioned to do the dirty to render a child,
I don’t want anything to do with zuckerco. I haven’t deleted fb or insta, but I haven’t used either one of them in months,
It already does allow it. Get a quest 2.,
Who wants an alternate universe without sex ! ! !,
Everybody be walking around as Unics,
The meta verse is going to be just like Facebook with avatars….. groups of echo chambers being influenced by propaganda generating public and media figures. 

And the “fact checkers” will be there to make sure meta can claim they are doing their best to control it all.,
I used to use a voice oscillator in voice chat while playing WOW to make myself sound like a teen girl. The guild thought I was 17, I even went so far as to fabricate a Facebook page with a whole backstory and it just kept snowballing. All for free shit, dibs on Loot, etc... Fuckin thirsty bois would fly across Azeroth to help me kill an elite or help with a quest. I played a Draenei Huntard, I didn't need fucking help. Holy hell do men fall over each other to help a perky 40 year old man.,
Can’t wait to see wsb members giving virtual blowjobs behind meta wendys to buy the dip,
Lol. Vice news. Coomer hands wrote that article.   


Roblox and Warzone don't need sex to be great so i don't understand why zuckerberg's does. They have that content delivery AI that triggers strong emotional responses(rage baiting) to suck in and keep the audience,
real,
100% Short,
Thus sayeth 30 something internet virgins,
Seeeeeeeeexxxxxx,
I mean that was the only thing I was looking forward to 😄,
Bearish on this. I don't think the optical side of AR tech is there. I don't think the actual useability of VR for anything more than fucking about/ gaming is there.,
Agree 100%. Cuz then it's all rape.,
It’s zuckerberg doesn’t have sex LoL,
Title is a splash misleading,
"We're all gonna get laid!" - Tom DeLonge,
DONT. CUCK. THE. ZUCC.,
They should allow sex and STDs. 'Whered your avatar get that cold sore?' Lol,
All metaverse need a red light district.,
It's not Zuckerbergs metaverse, you have misunderstood it,
You know that everyone you have sex with in the meta verse is going to be Zuckerbergs wife.,
Nah, sex robots is where it is really at. invest in robotics and AI,

Hey /u/doublemctwist1260, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
As a closet gay bear, I’m in for this roller coaster.,
I'm old enough to remember 1975-85 interest rates, and earlier. The market changes. Constantly.  

I agree, the FED has so totally distorted the market that it's totally cloud cuckoo.,
even growthy shit that is already down like 70%+ on the year though?,
You do realize that all this leverage built up in the system is related to the patch jobs the fed has been doing for the past 35 years right? He can slow the spigot, but turning the spigot off will decimate the entire global economy and make Lehman look like childs play.,
And Evergrande might default on 12/5. I've been buying FOTM FD puts since Monday in expectation of this downturn and will take profits on Friday (via spreads so I can profits if it continues to tank). And use some of those profits to buy OTM FD calls for 12/10 to prep for the likely after hours wire that is sent to avoid default.,
So what do we buy smart guy,
He’s right. Anyone over 40 saw this movie in 2000.  Growth stocks get obliterated first (dot.coms in 2000, today Cathie Wood stuff), then they kick Big Tech in the nuts (intc, csco, mot in 2000, today it will be Faang) then they lightly smack around whatever’s left.  Amzn dropped 96% from 1999-2001 as rates inched up.  If rates start going up growth = death, tech = pain, value = survival.,
ok take my upvote,
Tesla calls I’m in,
Dis good dd. Maybe some charts with dickz and more insults next time. I bought puts after i read this.,
JPowell the gains goblin,
It will take years for fixed income to start becoming attractive, even if rates go up by a couple dozen bps in the next few months.,
Put on Tesla, I tried 10k a year, now it is time,
Fed tapering tho, so your rate hike is a few months out. Fed still buying fk ton of bonds music still plays,
Take a Valium and chill,

I feel so frustrated I dropped 1400 on some 0dte spy puts and sold them for 3700 1 hour later...by close they were worth 100k fml why does keep happening to me,
You are down all time because maybe you don’t secure profit quick enough?

Great play though!,

As an employee I regret to see people supporting this company. I don’t know about the national scale, but the Houston division (which covers South Texas and Louisiana) has repeatedly stepped on the workers union, refuses to pay current employees competitive wages while hiring new employees at higher wages, and is actively hiring new strikebreakers during current strikes. It might not make a difference to you, but realize that those gains are made at the expense of the employees.,

Paragraph’s are your friend,
What the fuck is a sentence,
Love when I see “risk free”. Only on WSB,
Buying a call and selling a put at the same strike is not risk free!  It has the same risk profile as owning 100 shares.

If the underlying's price drops below your strike your short put becomes a liability.

Am I missing something?,
I think your looking for r/thetagang. Premium farming is a great way to preserve wealth and grow your account 10-20% a year but isn't going to make or lose wife changing money overnight.,
He learned options before paragraphs..,
Total retard,
Have you ever heard of box spreads and how those are also risk free?,
This kid is going places,
I think you're definitely on something but I'm too retarded with options to know what you meant. I'm slowly becoming less retarded with posts like these but thank you for sharing the idea of abusing option to mitigate losses,
The problem with synthetic long positions is that it will eat up a lot of your buying power if you have Reg T margin… on portfolio margin… well that shit is just free money,
Pro tip u can even get paid by buying and selling those options from different providers!,
What about early assignment,
You can still get fucked on options liquidity here.,
So your saying this can’t go tits up? Sounds familiar hmmmm 🤔,

Nice.,
Must be cashing out before Ghislaine Maxwell’s testimony.,
isn´t $69 billion peanuts nowadays?,
Is this not for tax reasons? And they are reinvesting it immediately,
Neat, no insiders for GME have sold since June,
They already know whats coming,
It must be really cool to know what happens with what stock in the future. Even if you are the one who causes it. Must be just really cool.,
Maybe insiders want to go on vacation,
Bullish signal. Also the record year of the share dilution and share buybacks 🤑,
Is it really that impressive when you consider that 1/3rd of that came from Alexander carp?,
Wasn’t a third of that Elon though,
That does not seem like much money. Also I bet most of that money has been reinvested in the market anyway. A lot of that total too is elons options payout so this is extremely misleading.,
People trying to justify tesla valuations then Elon's sell off. yet stay long when even the CEO is taking profits ..  sounds like  a cult to me.

When tsla bubble explodes it will take the whole market with it tho,
“Look at all these idiot retail investors buying more and more.” We just keep giving them more money.,
Say hello to *market crash*,
Nice,
A lot of that has to do with the fact that these guys doubles their worth in 12 months. What’s the point of doing that if you never spend it….,
Except for… GameStop,
When there is talk of “unrealized gains” tax, I don’t blame them.,
So basically they will sell 420B?,
Selling underperforming stocks at the end of the year is a well documented tax strategy to offset gains. It’s a record amount because these people made a killing.,
only a bigger number because their wealth has increased though? not that different a percentage of total wealth?,

My OCD is very satisfied at the perfect 10k gain, well played retard,
Let's hope it keeps drilling tomorrow,
Nice and tomorrow is Thursday so theta is about to chunk that shit. Hope it’s not a slightly green or sideways day,
Yo-yo all week,
lol did you limit sell to make it exactly 10k?,
Easiest money I’ve ever seen,
Bear make money, bull make money and ape get slaughter. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
But the thing is did u sell it?,
But how??? 🦧,
wait how is your avg cost 2.89?,
I’ve lost that much twice. I made it all back by making $1000 a week for a year straight buying meme stocks on robinhood then lost it all again by buying robinhood itself.,
I pissed away $200K on $NIO $XPEV and other crap EV stinks trying to diversify beyond $TSLA in March of this year when they were at their peak. Sold some $TSLA to do this genius move. GUH. That said, been making better choices since that shit show.,
I sold LCID at 19.50 at the end of September 😤😔,
What convinced you that WISH was worth throwing $64,000 at it?,
Set up that recurring investment bro.,
I guhed on BABA,
Curious what the other .02 % of your portfolio is?,
Moment? $WISH is a guh marathon,
I have a feeling its well over just 1 "guh" per tard,
Charge your phone,
At least it isn’t a workhorse bag!,
I knew I should have held my fucking put longer sum BITCH,
I lost 30k today! In one day. Keep up,
Cut losses quickly.  It takes 100 percent gain to make back a 50 percent loss.  You need to be cutting under 10 percent.,
Not even options. You’re even more retarded than you realize.,
Next time don't buy a hyped up shitcompany,
I lost $8000 in 20 minutes selling SPX put credit spreads a couple weeks ago.  Guh!,
DO NOT do a recurring investment.,
"1" GUH moment?

Yea..you are new to the market..,
Keep it ~~down~~ up and sell when it hits the floor i.e. $0.0000001,
Why would you invest in wish, have you seen the people who use it they are bums and meth addicts,
They’re gonna delist for sure lol,
What is the other .02%,
At least 10 is more accurate,
Battery needs to be charged,
Been there a couple times this year, clawing back at 20% from start,
Good Job!,
You could’ve bought a lot of cheap dildos with that….,
Hmm. This is probably not good,
Buy high, sell low, cheat on your taxes,
Just keep averaging down and protect the float,
200 shares at $10.04 per.   

I wonder if my $3 puts will print.  Or was that just as stupid as buying the stock?   🤦‍♂️,
Another smooth brained retard.,
Mine was investing in Greek shipping stocks during the crash.,
Maybe if it only fell 38 cents instead of 38.00 cents you'd be fine.,
If you invest in Wish, you literally deserve to lose every penny.,
Why the fuck didn’t you cut losses quickly before they were a liability? Have an entry and exit plan before every trade you take for both winning and losing. Always have a stop loss. Never fomo. You can always get out with most of your money and buy back in at a better price later,
so glad I sold when it went to 6.2$ why keep holding? you waiting for it to hit 0?,
Why people keep posting wish thing? Am i the only one who is tired of this shit!!,
If it makes you feel better JP Morgan had a target price of $17 the week $WISH tanked then a week later changed the target to $5.,
Dont feel ao bad now for losing $1000 on wish. Guess that means my real GUH moment is coming.,
Sell covered calls for life,
That is not your GUH moment. This is nothing.  Just wait. Next time by options you pussy.,

I mean you aren’t at 0 yet…,
Godspeed autist,
Might as well take that 30k out and buy SPY calls and either get 0 or 100k a lot faster than you’re on pace to get 0 now,
I’ll give you $35k rn if you transfer your shares to my account.
DEAL or NO Deal?,
What's that other lucky 7% tucked away in,
30k is pretty good. Only needs a double or nothing bet and you’ll be back in profit,
I hate this stock so much. Moderna should see if it's immunity to green days can apply to the coronavirus.,
The IRS hates this one weird trick.,
It’s gonna go up WE NEED POSITIVE SENTIMENT!🍀,
For those about to hit zero ... I salute you,
it ll recovery eventually, valuation looking ridiculously low, there new app update starting to look much cleaner too,
Shit you still have $30-K to lose. You are in great shape !,
Zak said 69....,
Ahh fuck it! 0 or 🚀 that’s my plan anyway you do whatever you want,
All or nothing brotha man,
Please tell me youre selling calls on them at least,
Do you know there is limit and stop loss order type in your account? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Sell calls all the way down. At least walk away with some juice. It is never going to come back up to 7 bucks with out a reverse split.,
I must have missed the memo on WISH. Why did so many people buy-in in the first place? I've heard nothing but bad things about the company - even before people were posting all their loss porn.,
Looks like you followed Zack Morris lmao,
Will this even recover?,
WISH stock is exactly like what you get in the mail.,
Sell and buy 0dte puts, no other option,
You still have 30k to make better plays with,
I'd cash out and hit the inflated dollar menu for a junior bacon cheeseburger and kids frosty,
Pull out and buy ccxi February $60 calls. If it works out send me a pizza,
At least you’ve got the jimmies to post the loss porn on your dumbass investment.,
You ‘wish’ those calls you sold recouped more than 5% of this loss,
Use the green crayon next time, retard.,
I 🤞  you the best.,
Look up lost cost phallacy  also sell those shares and buy puts on ARKG, you’re welcome,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
By aapl calls I beg you,
Ive been playing puts and cackling on webull at all the comments.

&#x200B;

God speed though sir,
May be you deserve that! Market doesn’t care about you emotion,
A captain always goes down with his ship.,
I’m holding to ZERO as well.  Too retarded to do anything else.,
If you flip your phone sideways, you’re crushing it.,
Anyone on RH deserves this,
Who convinced everyone that WISH is a good company. Its like a novelty, you order some cheap crap, you get a laugh at how garbage what you ordered was, then you buy from somewhere else. Who wants to shop from a place that sends you unusable garbage?,
 What did you honestly think would happen?,
Lol imagine buying 9k shares in trash truly 🤡 timeline.,

looks like they think Omicron is transitory,
Interesting… Also, China is forcing many steel mills and foundries to shut down, as they want blue skies for the Winter Olympics.,
Was selling puts for beer money but no beer for me this week...,
So should i go all in?,
CLF is a great one to have in the portfolio, they're making mad profit and are going to do so year on out as the main steel manufacturer. Easily 30+ USD in the not so long future

Source: trust me bro,
CLF also redeemed some notes today.

Debt reduction is going well.,
Baddest CEO out there.,
Sooo buy? I’m new to stocks but have money to invest,
Why do they keep shorting this stock? It makes no sense,
I read the headline, tries to understand the numbers and then threw money at clf. Bless my heart,
So?  GENI insiders bought 300K shares today,
X and CLF gonna climb for the next 5 years. This play is cake.,
Cliffs Toledo plant keeps pumping white smoke so the iron is flowing,
Jocko was on JRE reminding us that containers are costing 5x to ship to the US...and that's going to fuck up the cost advantage of Chinese steel in a big way.,
I think CLF will trading in the mid 20’s by late winter,
So?,
[removed],
TL:DR, my $23 2/18/22 calls I bought yesterday going to print or nah?,
CEO LG slaps analysts butts like Tom Cruise. leaderBeans!,
They like holding bags.,
Ok and?,
Okay I’m buying puts at open,
Way more people have access to the Stock market nowadays and tech isnt only a speculative asset but has become a huge Part of All our lives.,
Correct the PE to interest rates, graph shows a different picture. Liquidity is chasing returns bidding up prices, very different to dot con which was euphoric expectations ignoring returns of a cash rate/treasury and the other sectors.

‘Everything is overpriced’ is a common statement, well you are competing against leveraged institutional buyers backed by fed interest rate suppression- yes returns will be low, valuations will be high.,
The crash didn't happen all at once..
Pets.com was shot first, basically the rivian of the time
Then other 8nternet stocks like jeeves, etc.
Finally it came for serious businesses like Cisco

What's the relationship to today?

Highest speculation will die first. Krypto or EV is my guess

Then other high flyers 

Then serious businesses that are overpriced will get a haircut.

So I'm watching for a speculative market to crash before I start thinking about sitting on the sidelines.,
I fully believe that there will be a crash.  Now about when........,
Here, let me put an end to this bubble talk - ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
It is a bubble if you ignore stocks getting absolutely punished hard after missing estimates. 

EV sector for sure is in a different reality but the rest of the market is relying on earnings for the most part.,
I'm about to make the smooth-brained move of pulling my 401K out of growth funds and into bond funds, just until Jan/Feb and see how things look.,
No shit it’s bubble, but what are you supposed to do? put your money in worthless bonds or in a savings account that pays close to zero?,
The thing is, assets aren't more valuable; the dollars are worth less. What's at stake isn't a bubble popping, it's the USD bursting into flames.,
Sell the stocks that are pumped up the most, keep the cash on hand to buy after any crash, keep holding stocks with less potential to lose half their value during a correction.,
Maybe... but are you going to time it right so your puts don't expire worthless 😂,
We are in a balloon and not a bubble, and Powell and company are going to slowly deflate the balloon.

The only bubble is ridiculous high PE or no profit companies.,
Solid DD…and a really smart Dot Com perspective.

Tech/Dot Com investing in 2000 was much more irrational than it is today.
==================================
- Many stonks that fueled the 2000/Dot Com bubble/crash didn’t have an E for the P/E ratio. 
- These companies NEVER made any money…and didn’t even have a 5 year profitability forecast. 
- Finance folks tripped over themselves to invest in Dot Com IPOs without any DD. 

Many High PS stocks have already dropped by 50%+ from ATHs.
==================================
- Already seems like a correction.
- This never happened in the Dot Com bubble…until it crashed.,
Stonks only go up so who cares.,
Nice read. Thank you.,
There's always a bull market somewhere.....people have been calling for a crash since 2018....it will happen eventually but predicting it is harder than my wife's boyfriends cock.,
Dude, the market radically changed in march 2020 because of unlimited free money and people who didn’t know what stocks were dumped their stimulus into the market in lockdown. Since then, all they have seen is massive gains leading them to believe they are stock picking geniuses. When easy money ends and a slight bear market kicks in, it will be a self reinforcing cycle,
This is really great, thanks for putting in the effort and actually providing some reasonable information.,
I love the data and the analysis.  My big question is "if not the equity markets then where?"  The low interest rate environment fuels the fire for stocks for sure but it also takes away the alternative to the stock market.  In the good old days - let's define that as pre 2010 - as you got older you were encouraged  to put more and more money into bonds.  The rule of thumb was a % in bonds equal to your age.  Fast forward to today and you simply can't do that and expect to live off of your retirement savings.  So dividend aristocrats have replaced bonds in the boomer's portfolios and everything has been moved one rung up the risk ladder.,
This bubble will probablt be called the EV bubble.,
I guess if we all get scared and sell all our holdings, institutions and elites can buy up all our shares at a sweet deal and get even more rich, cause they don't have enough money and control yet. 
Wait a second....maybe that's their plan!,
Bruh we’re in a fed bubble,
I'd be willing to bet that there's good DD in there, but I can't read all that before the market crashes.,
>[1] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering. In the 1980s average commission per trade was $45.

So it'll be a faster exit this time around.,
We're not in a buble, we're in the biggest prosperity times ever, we're traveling to Mars and shit.,
Ah yes, I recognize some of these pictures.  I’ll TL;DR for everyone.  It’s going to go up until it goes down, then when it goes down enough it’ll start going back up again.,
Keep buying puts and losing money then.  

What is this doomer shit.,
What's the TL;DRS on this?,
>The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens.

Man I remember everyone was saying this right before the 2000 bubble crashed.,
So let me tell you something about '99.  You didn't see homeless people crowding every corner, pitching their tents, doing crank and shitting squatting in the cold light of an uncaring dawn.

Let me tell you something about 2008: sure, folks had 3 homes and all on neg-am or ARMs, but they had somewhere to lay their head.

Right now 60% of young people feel our system is broken and they have no opportunity for advancement.  And yet unemployment is lower than structural averages and the market is pretty much supposed to be at a top.  This is supposed to be the best and strongest our system can do as we prepare to remove monetary stimulus, declaring victory.

If you ain't the 1% - and I am the 1%, just making an observation here - you ain't win anything in the last 20 years.  Many have lost everything.  In the long run the market is a weighing machine: and when it weighs in the balance this period of capital misallocation, political kick-the-can-ism, industrial inefficacy, environmental ruination, and sociocultural decay, it is going to be found most wanting.,
I like to think of the current market as a game of musical chairs. Only there are about 20 chairs in a game of 100 people who have been walking to music for so long they forgot it’s going to stop,
Great analysis!
Personally, I'm not sure if it's a bubble or just continuation of bull market from 2009 driven by obscenely low interest rates and fed stimulus. Either way, the next recession is going to be a BITCH!

Also, don't forget, the guv'ment brought out a fresh 1.3 TRILLION dollar punch bowel with the infrastructure bill.  Our great-great-great grandchildren will probably still be paying for this! But hey, keep trading, this party could still go on for a while.,
If you don't think we're in a bubble you're literally retarded.,
Bro, look at the buy now pay later" shit these days. This is a global issue. Fucking terrifying. As an example, PayPal saw a 400% increase in the use of their buy now, pay later program. 

 Seriously, we're fucked. We're printing money like crazy, and with these buy now pay later schemes, no one is spending the money they currently posses on those goods, probably just bullshit like going out or booze. Then, they don't have any money to pay when payment is due. They default, the banks default, money is meaningless, and everyone cries "government, help!!!". This is 2008 all fucking over again. 

Oh, best part, when all of the TV, furniture, cars, houses, and etc. are repossessed, everyone is going to be financially fucked forever and have to try and buy these things back at whatever the fuck cost is set by the institutions that repossessed these items, plus inflation and markup. 

Did no adult, or adolescent alive during the 2008 crash, warn their now 18+ year old kids of this danger?,
I am a bot from /r/wallstreetbets.                                You submitted one or more banned tickers: COM CAPE.

                                Message /u/zjz if they're above 1.5 billion-ish market cap and not related to crypto/pennies/OTC.,
TL;DR,
Didn't have QE in 2008,
Something that seems entirely overlooked by the market. Most earnings in 2020-2021 were entirely artificial and driven by the 4T in stimulus injected by the government.

The likelihood that earnings are simply permanently higher after a one time injection of money is very low. The government hands somebody a dollar, they spend it, it's gone at that point. There was no enhanced productive capacity of the economy.


The alternative outcome is that inflation is persistently high, which could support earnings gains in nominal terms.

So far, despite stimulus programs waning, consumer has maintained spending through debt, but consumers will be tapped out on debt within the next few months.

My money is on massive earnings misses in 2022 and a big correction. It's the only logical outcome when you consider a one time stimulus injection.,
to many words, uppies or downies?,
So buy calls, got it,
Bubble boy,
Yes, we are in a bubble.,
Way worse than you think. The us is about to default on their debt come end of dec / jan,
[removed],
Nice to there is still a ways up to go,
Not there yet,
We got made from either a bubble or bubble burst! And it repeats itself,
People like to talk about crashes but a dot-com bubble type situation is more of a concern for me. Less flashy but a slower recovery with several straight red years for the market overall.,
All of this just to come out the closet,
yes we are 

the media want me to sell,
Someone tel me if it’s yes or no thanjs,
Bubble? I'm 40% down on my small caps since Feb 2021... It should go to 0 for me to lose anymore,
People are going to get sticker shock when they see equity prices in 5-10 years,
Does technical analysis mean something again?,
You know the ratio could also come down if earnings explode due to inflation.,
Yes… the answer is yes. It’s like the  big boiler onmy neck. I just let it get bigger and bigger , until one day it pops on its own . It’s the size of a golf ball. Hoping to get it to water balloon size by Christmas. Let the good times roll,
Stimulus checks and $0 commission fees have made number of traders and volume at an all-time high. Once people realize they need their Wendy’s paycheck to pay for the fomo FDs and once rates go up, they’ll pull out quick. If a market crashes in the woods and no ones around will it still make a sound?,
Very high quality post my respect,
It definitely is coming. Holding is a good method to get slaughtered last.,
Lot of text to be dumb and wrong,
Overall? No. Some industries? Fuck yes.

Market could easily drop 20% though and it would be fairly valued.,
So as rates go back up everything will come back down,
Hard to see how all of this isnt priced in already, market crashes when something unexpected happens (covid lockdown in 2020, mark to market accounting rules sudden implementation + MBS in 2007, sudden crash of worldcom and others in 2000 due to fraud). Literally everyone who has a pulse and a broker knows that they’re tapering, inflation is real, china, probably going to raise rates slowly, etc. Everyone jerking themselves off on twitter that it has to crash because valuations are high, obviously everyone knows and is already hedging. Look at 13Fs, most big players are still heavily invested. Its dipping this week heavily because omicron was unexpected and there’s a possibility of a 2020-style crash if its more virulent/vaccine-resistant, on top of the fed meeting. When that turns out not to be a problem it will rally big, people just don’t want to be on the bad end of a 2020 sudden covid crash so they’re hedging since the omicron news (leading to a dip).,
Its funny because the us gov has so much outstanding debt hat they physically cannot raise rates past a certain point. Until they actually turn off qe it will just be an ebb and flow slowly pushing up, there is no better risk to reward ratio than equity right now because bonds dont have to compete with tbills

Imagine corp bonds with 10% rates to best out 6% t bills, stocks would have to fucking PRINT to beat that shit. But no yields are practically 0. Corp bonds are fee solid points but you could just hold conservative stocks and double that pretty easily. Its a no brainer until liquidity is dry and rates force real growth we are stuck in the speculative, earnings rat race to get out and in before the next chump,
Rally? I’m down 52% since highs fell,
Yeah but Evergrande,
Why is SDC in that list? Just cause of that I can’t and won’t take anything else you said seriously lmao, come on,
Op I just wanna say I love the graph animation on the index fund bubble post,
Thanks for the likes and award despite my fat fingers and typos...,
Counterpoint: the feds duel mandate of full employment and stable prices got fukked with terrible labor participation rate drilling to the earths core and inflation shooting for the stars. 

They gotta raise rates ASAP. This will increase the cost of capital and ppl will sell just to preserve their winnings.,
Damn I wish I could read... and wasn't color blind...,
Jesus, you guys are hodlers,
tldr fagget,
First decentralized options platform $IBFR on coin gecko. Micro mc, let’s ape,
Wrong discussion but similar topic. I know everyone hates Michael burry but I saw him comment once about index funds driving prices up and one day going to cause a bubble. I think we are still 20+ years off of that but I think it brings up a good point. If everyone is investing in the sp 500 you are continuing to drive those prices up every two weeks as people keep buying and buying. Say one company isn't making the cut or they are reshuffling shares it can easily have an impact. I think it is a good discussion. Idk how it would end but I do think it is interesting theory. My thought on the OP is that we have some correction or reset in 2023. Rates increasing, debt increasing, debt servicing out of control, labor inflation etc etc,
"Be fearful when others are greedy, be gay as fk when bears are just the tips." - Straight Bull,
This post took 2 morning shits for me to read. Good post.,
Thing I figure out is : rich got richer and will keep on getting richer, market is manipulated to every level and no one who has the power to change it seems to care (cause they benefit) 
Some apes were smart and surf the ride and made bank, other apes (like me) are holding bags and dream of better days. 
The sad part about the market is you can’t have winners without having losers.,
Gold has been held below actual value for years (for centuries gold never changed value compared to certain commodities; the same amount by weight of gold would buy the same amount of eggs, flour, lumber, etc.; if prices fluctuated the gold value of those items stayed the same in relation, same with all inflation), ask an economist when they aren’t around other economists.  most are willing to talk about it with friends but not where anyone is listening, the last one I talked to got real weirded out (we weren’t friends and I asked in a public setting after finding out his profession) when I asked, like looking all around, asking who I was and who I work for paranoid.  Like, “I haven’t told anyone that the (insert your favorite conspiracy group here) are controlling gold prices, please, I have a family and want to live” kind of paranoid weirded out…..  add that shit to the bubble that is real estate, and the government intrusion (again) into pharmaceuticals (the politicians are all heavily invested in MRNA which is up over $300 from mar2020, and all the other wierd shit going on and yes…. SOME things are in a bubble, but that doesn’t matter, none of it matters, if you don’t know who is controlling the bubble(s) and when they are going to sell their shares, invest it all in puts and “burst the bubble” for lack of better phrasing…. 

Knowing there are active bubbles in various markets and investing is like going to a casino where the games are rigged and gambling where you think the House is going to allow you to win because you are betting small where nobody else is and hoping house would rather give you baubles than allow others at table to win big…. the problem with that is that you don’t know if there are shills at the table winning big to make it look like gambling is lucrative; and the shill is playing with house money so if everyone starts betting big with the shill then the house stops it at the right moment that everyone loses half their stack in one roll of the dice, one spin of the wheel, one little hand where the dealer pulls a natural twenty one when everyone else split or double downed a bunch of twenties….

This is not advice on investing…. neither is it advice on not investing…. It is a simple reminder that you are gambling in a casino where you get no say in what the rules are or when the other parties involved are allowed to ignore the rules….,
is it adjusted for inflation?,
Money flows away from shit stocks quite quickly. Now people are also pumping SP500 companies that have the business. Maybe some companies are overvalued but this is not a bubble.,
Yeah,  it's an everything bubble so if a single segment of collateral dips below mark to market the entire global economy goes into an irreversible death spiral. JPOW knows this so the only option is to try to inflate the debt away.  Money printer will continue to brrrrr.,
For those who are worried about a crash but have money on the sidelines and aren’t sure what to do with it: I have been parking my money in pre-DA SPACs that I purchase as close to the NAV ($10/share) as possible which limits my losses.

Then once a merger-DA is announced, if it is a decent company the SPAC increases in value, often 15-20% and I sell. Its a tough way to make gains and you need to have patience and know how SPACs work, but it is a fairly conservative strategy if you can get in close to the NAV. If you understand options, selling covered calls isn’t a bad way to make a modest income while you wait as well (just knowing that if DA is announced while you are short calls you could be severely limiting your gains).

SPACs have a “risky” reputation because after the merger about 90% of them lose value due to dilution, PIPEs, and possibly bad valuations. But if you sell the news upon merger, you often are ok. And in the instance you actually like the target company and are okay holding long term, some SPACs have turned out well - see DKNG or SOFI for example. The biggest thing when choosing a SPAC is to choose one with a good management team and track record. There are hundreds of SPACs out there, and maybe only over a dozen I can name that have good management teams. Quality matters.

*Not investment advice, do your own DD*,

If you think iPhones are the reason AAPL touched $170, you were probably touched as a child,
Ah, so there’s a reason it’s tanking other than an 85 rsi? My 160 weekly puts I bought yesterday are gonna be on fire at open. Wonder if I should sell or not (probably yes),
Aapl down bigly premarket,
Bulli... Oh shit, it's almost like the underlying economy is not very strong and the money printers slowing down...,
That's what happens when you make a more expensive phone and 95% if the people who buy it are sitting at home collecting unemployment😅,

So the newest iPhone isn’t that much different than the previous model?  That’s crazy,
Apple is going to be riding the new MacBookPro wave for 3-5 years.,
I checked the Verizon website and they are back ordered into January. Kind of a mixed message.,
My family all got iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro Max and are back ordered until end of January.,
Because their iPhones are the fucking same thing over and over again. They stopped innovating,
Tis the season to buy presents not $1100 phones tralalala la la laaaa,
They run this story every fucking year at this time. Usually it’s Digitimes or equivalent, but Bloomberg has really gone down the toilet in recent years.,
Blood bath confirmed for Tomorrow, no one can hold SPY now.,
Wonderful News!,
Well shit. My family just upgraded for four new iPhone 13 pro Maxs. I guess we’re the ones driving the market. But the trade-in values for the old phones were soooooooooo good.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
Title is sensationalist garbage.

Demand hasn’t slowed, but the demand forecast for the holidays has been lowered based on inflation. / covid concerns…. Yet even the new forecast predicts a 6% sales increase for first 3 months of the year. Which is excellent',
This is what happens when you price a phone as much as an old used car.,
Because everyone who wants one has one and you made too many fucking models.,
I’m using an iPhone Xs and have seen absolutely no reason to upgrade over the last three generations.  There have been zero new features of any sort that add any value for me. Marginally faster processor and better camera don’t matter to me. I’ve already got 12 MP and I haven’t noticed any slow down at all over the past 3 years.,

Sold mine last month at $152-153 ish.,
What for the first quarter tesla numbers are going the opposite direction as predictions.,
Have people finally decided to stop buying the same phone each yr?,
Stock was just raised to $200 PT,

I would just give him candy.,
Put the missing chromosomes in the bag,
"well, this is awkward.",
Did he get charged or did someone think it was a "joke",
Is the guy on cap still alive? Im worried,
He forgot his helmet,
I'm crying,
Brilliant, you've swayed me,
I laughed, felt bad, and got depressed within 3 seconds. Good job OP.,
If you click on the video you can clearly see he is autistic. 

Probably reading this right now,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
The slippers make it classic. How can you take any retard serious when he's wearing slippers? Any retard knows slippers blows your cover. Send the poor bastard home with a box of Captain Crunch for his effort.,
u/savevideo,

Bruh that clerk sucked, should've played along and given him a chocolate or something, kid is hilarious,
$AAPL went up today, idk what was up with $MSFT today.,
I ugly laughed at this…. Anybody have a context for the original video?,
Down bad,
They sometimes go downs,

With how many accessories there are for guns nowadays, my ass is sitting here wondering if that's a real gun or a nerf gun,
Me thinking if I should invest more into the crypto $OMI,
Buy puts of MRNA,
He has down syndrome,
Am all for us calling each other retarded but let’s leave people with actual downs out of it in gifs n shit.,
I'm offended.,
It's a funny video but what's the connection with the title? We should not let this place degenerate further to a funny gif sharing platform,
[removed],
u/savevideo,
I feel like I'm the only one that made shit tons the last few months. Thank you EDU and BABA shorts!,
Which one of you mongoloids is this?,
The week still looks like it’s gonna end green though. Santa Rally incoming.,
[removed],
The guy rally didn't say anything. Just started motioning.,
So inspirational,
me when wendys is closed during the holidays,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
He should have clapped that fool up,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
What’s the original video called?,
"Give me all the money in your piggie bank and nobody gets hurt",
Potato gun....,
You bastard made me laugh in tear. Fuck it,
That's stupid enough to work,
This was his most retarded decision in life at the time.,
Guy looks about right too.,
Unfortunately just  like the robber, it’s only down.,
[removed],
S&P is arleady bouncing back, this bull run will never end I can promise you, bear market will be old men tale.,
😂😭,
Can just imagine him going through a list of different toy guns. Water gun -> nerf gun -> toy bow and arrow  with suction tip -> airsoft gun -> slingshot -> minecraft sword,
dude deserves a quarter at least.,
Yeah I really need a turnaround. Stat lol,
Is it wrong i want abortion illegal just so we can have more memes like this?,
u/savevideo,

Fuck wall street for creating a sea of retail bag holders!!,
I’m right here with you, I finally put a stop loss for $31 I can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of soup for dinner,
I hate draftkings so much…down 31%.

My worst stock ever.,
OMG me too lol down about 2K myself. Seeing your post I don’t feel so bad haha,
I’d still load up on PLTR. That shit is gonna pop someday for sure,
Hey, look at bright side, you received $83 divided! Nice! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
What is going on? Finally sold it today …,
Well you started good. Not so much the finish.,
Ouchies.,
PINS killing me too,
Good luck on DKNG!  That’s a fast horse ridding to single digits.,
This makes me so happy,
... and then on that faithful day the OP found out that even though everyone says a million dollar is not a lot of money, as a matter of fact even $40k is a lot of money.,
You were doing well until it started going red. Hope that helps.,

Those who choose to trade this market over the next year or so will find out how literal this gif is.,
Its been 10+ years of near 0%.  This is going to cause a crash, theres no doubt about it.  The Fed caused the 2008 crash as well, yet now they talk as if they are experts in the economy, despite the fact they never saw it coming.  Maybe if they'd predicted something and done something they'd have some credibility.

This idea thats its possible to avoid now is senile, after this long of free liquidity and propping up zombie companies, the only reason people havent evacuated already is because of the inevitable Fed backtrack as they've done before.  They have zero credibility so its impossible for anyone to even take them serious.

But literally everybody in the world is ready to jump on bonds and get out of stocks, but nobody wants to buy bonds before interest rates go up, so its a dam ready to burst.  This idea that we're going to have a smooth landing is bonkers, this money is leveraged into everything from housing to municipal maintenance budgets.,
Rrrrrrrrib my calls.

Holy fuck man, you gotta remember to put your helmet on.,
Full retard.,
Fuck if you liked it at $228… I bet you are loving it at $182…,,???,
Good lord… if you happen to have another 200k today might be a decent spot for a shove,
omfg lmao,
I'm sorry for your loss.,
Nice move will probably pay out. Imagine if it squeezed for you,
Why + margin ?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Now I want to do this!,
Holy moly, mother of retards. I applaud you for your beautiful risk tolerance

How the F did the remind me thing work again?,
F,
This energy right here,
Very risky, the GameStop price at $228 was very high and was pumping for a day or two at that point. This reminds me of cryp70 traders that wait 4 hours into a pump then lay heavy into the coin. Why not wait for the inevitable crash down below $200? I don't understand the mentality behind "it went up a lot, so it must go up a lot more" that is prevalent in this and the coin subreddit.,
Oof,
you're about a year too late there....,
why if i may ask,

Use the schwartz young padawan,

Call on triple leveraged inverse ETF? Love it. GL OP!,
Won’t you earn more by buying puts for TQQQ?
The decay for SQQQ will eat back some of the returns,

Fuck it im in,
Definitely will go back over $30 once supply and chip issues go away.

Then their revenue should grow.,
I think I saw around 100 Corsair DD during the last couple of month, I might get in after I see maybe 10 more,
Tax loss harvesting will keep it low until the new year, next year it will pop off tho,
Ngl worth a revisit.  

Elaborate on growth please, what's their growth projection for 2022 and 2023 assuming a normal supply chain.  
Can they compete vs razor and Logitech and all the other china/taiwanese gaming companies?  

Price to sales of 1 is never bad.  Especially for situations like now,
I own shares but this thing has been on a long term downtrend for awhile now with no sign of stabilizing anywhere. I think it’ll do great in the future but I’m not trying to catch a falling knife. I’ll wait for some stability before I consider adding more shares,
Won’t be a good stock for 5 years,
Anyone who is not buying now at $22 a share (or even lower) is missing and absolute steal,
[removed],
That 40 percent Short Interest of the float is smoking this thing. I cant decide if I should tax harvest or just hold.,
LOGI is the better play by far,
Always love me some corsair hype. This has been undervalued for a long time.,

0 percent chance space x goes bankrupt,
Bought $RKLB two weeks back.,
Am I the only retard that was trying to figure out why OP was associating Roblox with Space X… duh…,
I'm up about 35% on a handful of 8c leaps I bought a couple months ago basically as synthetic shares. Planning on riding them all the way through as they've got a real chance to be multi-baggers.

I LOVE SPACE 🚀,
Have 10k shares, love this company. I see space being the thing PMs adopt in mass next, just like how EVs are now. Could see this hitting 50b in a few years. 


I'd buy Spacex too if I could, Elon could sneeze in his hand, call it a start up and raise a billion. Don't see Spacex ever going bankrupt especially when he is selling 10% of his Tesla holdings. He has the cash to keep it going if he needed to.,
There is ZERO chance that Space X goes bankrupt. Elon can personally fund it to the tune of billions, which he absolutely will, just as he did before and as he did for Tesla.,
Already in for [425 shares](https://imgur.com/a/j465FJ9) and [2 20c 4/14/22](https://imgur.com/a/JRDypzj)

Page 8 of the S-1 has a clause called “ensuring shares” which gives investors from when the company was private free shares if RKLB closes above $20 for 20 consecutive days before 1/20.

#YOU KNOW RICH PEOPLE WANT MILLIONS OF FREE SHARES.

RKLB also [completed their acquisition of **Planetary Systems Corp.** two hours ago](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/rocket-lab-closes-acquisition-space-210500496.html) - the company that [**MAKES THE SATELLITE LAUNCHING MECHANISM USED BY SPACEX**](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/rocket-lab-acquires-planetary-systems-corporation-in-cash-and-stock-deal/amp/), meaning that RKLB now manufactures part of SpaceX rockets. Bullish.

Hey, /u/zjz PermaBan me if RKLB doesn’t close over $20 by 1/20. Also, i’ll jerk off AutoMod.,
There is no chance SpaceX goes bankrupt. 

FYI it is backed by the wealthiest person in the world.,
RKLB should be valued around $60 right now. $100 when they release information on the moon landing and $1000 when they are refueling in orbit,
So question is: what is the big announcement regarding the Electron Neutron tomorrow?,
Never know what the muskrat is really trying to say.  I say buy!  YOLO it.  Though I will not be following that gem of advice.,
Yeah you lost me at Elon Musk. That said I will gladly buy in when it's up 500% a couple months from now,  wake me up then.,
Got calls expiring on December 17th. LETS GET THESE TENDIES BOYS,
Got my golden tickets locked and loaded. Space industry is just heating up. I love RKLB’s vertical integration and plans to be an all around space company. I think they’ll capitalize on the growing industry and come out on top. Can’t wait for the Neutron update in 3 hrs.,
You had me at “Hi Retards.” 😂,
The fact that it’s public is bearish over private SpaceX. These companies are not made to be public this early,
My butt plug just popped out reading this holy tits!!!,
I am going to follow the advice and short RKLB,
wtf happened to starlink?,
Anyone read that as roblox,
Buy before news drop. After news drop, price can still go down unless really good news. I expect a drop.,
You had me at ate his hat! LFG!,
So much money waiting to get into Space X,
RKLB does seem like a decent bet in a market of total uncertainty and unpredictability.

I've got some shares so hoping 2022 will be a good year for those. Might do some options next year if things settle down.,
BECK with ROCKET TO DA MOON,
SpaceX was just recently raising funds and they over-subscribed in minutes, I doubt they’d ever have issues with lack of capital. Maybe if they sent a 1000 souls to mars and hit an asteroid midway they’d have an issue but not now…,
Posted this AM. $RKLB Neutron Engine update. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0thW57QeDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0thW57QeDM),
Are you saying Elon musk…. Exaggerated???!? He’s definitely not known for doing that. For real though spaceX is his baby he would dump his Tesla shares to keep that company going, it’s nowhere near going bankrupt or he could just take it public and it would literally pump to mars,
Technology wise these two aren't even comparable. SpaceX is literally unrivalable.,
Puts are in order just cuz of this post,
Sure I'll sell the 5 strike put for Jan 21 and buy the 2 strike put for May got my own thanks,

What’s this book about?,
as a fellow bagholder i feel your pain,
Definitely going to keep my eye on in it in the near and long term future! Good dd.,
5.6% up now, almost a 100, let's go!!!

(Funny, a couple of days ago, I was saying, OMG, this is gonna shit to 100 today),
Just do the opposite,
which call?,
The state regulations on medical records are holding back the industry. It’s going to take a long while to change that as it’s not a priority even though it should be.

May 2021: https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-is-down-another-8-this-week-dont-just-blame-poor-earnings-51620165243

>	the firm signaled that it expects little membership growth in 2021.

Kiss off death for growth companies. Especially ones that should be booming in this COVID environment. 

>	In a Wall Street Journal article published on Monday, PepsiCo ‘s former head of benefits, Erik Sossa, said that the company stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, parly because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. “Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,” Sossa told the Journal.

>	Such commentary isn’t new. Bruce Broussard, CEO of the health-insurance giant Humana (HUM), also called telehealth a commodity when discussing the firm’s recent acquisition of Kindred at Home


This thing ain’t recovering anytime soon.  I made a boatload on LVGO and proceeded to give it all up on holding on to this thing.  Hell, I even had money tied up in the HAAC SPAC headed by the former livongo execs that went nowhere for the whole year.

Cut some and move onto better,
hey. fellow lvgo shareholder here thats bagholding tdog now. oh tdoc. 

tdoc wants to contend with WISH, SDC, and BABA as one of worst performing stocks in the market. its been a  train wreck

are we near the bottom? have no idea. but im not selling at this comical price. if it goes to zero, so be it. but no way am i selling for a fraction of the price it could trade at in future, based on my DD.,
I have owned TDOC for a few months now, my average is around $135/share. This is a tough one for me because this stock still has awhile before profitable earnings but each quarter it shows good movement in the right direction (although slowing growth potentially). I already have a significant holding so im not really keen on picking up more, have to give it time and potential a few more earnings reports to have things go back in a bullish direction,
Yup, I have a power over the market. Just few minutes after posting this, TDOC moved 2.4% up :-),

Hey /u/Noble_Fr, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
I guess the market is not pricing in any earnings growth. Maybe even a drop in earnings once enough immunity is achieved and we learn to live with the virus as we do with our wives' boyfriends.,
Positions please, retard,

Lol these pussys selling $Pltr when the entire market is down.

Give it time you fucks.

&#x200B;

Also - fuck your options. Buy shares and hold this bitch,
There’s nothing to worry about when the entire market is down,
1600 shares. If your trading this your in for a bad time. If your investing. Your fine.,
I bought 100 shares today.,
Back at my avg share price. So much for 2021. Maybe we will get them in 2022,
Remove pltr from watchlist,
Down like 6k and still not gonna sell ever,
Piece of junk,
If the market crashes, I can’t think of a worse stock to own,
[deleted],
Why? What happened today with PLTR?,
Added. But not sure how I feel about it..,
Remove from WL.,
Bought calls,
$20 was my line.  Sadly I paper handed it today.  We'll see if there's future regrets.,
I don't even remember what I bought at...,

8000 tickers on the NYSE and you decide to put your life’s savings into that pile of shit, and keep it there, because of what some people on a **GAMBLING** subreddit said.

Sell and buy the SPY / QQQ dips you absolute mongoloid.,
BUY THE DIP 🖐🏽💎🤚🏽,
Well this is WSB!! where people have thousands invested in WISH stock. God speed 💪,
I don't know what spaxx is but I'm guessing you shouldn't have sold that.,
May I suggest an ETF or stocks you expect will do well in the future like a "normal" person?,
Sell while you can my boy.,
Maybe you should!,
I bought more today.,
The you sell for a loss Amazon and Google will get into a bidding war to take over the company,

too bad your phone will be dead by then,
More like FUBAR,
Tell margin I said hi 👋 😎,
Hey I’m retarded too I have 7,200 FUBO shares now! 👋🏼,
You have infinite time (shares…),
If she does call…reroute the call to Kenny. He’ll take care of it. He is a great guy.,
GL OP! My cost basis is $33 🤮,
My god! FUBO is 18??,
I used to be in Fubo. If that’s margin yeah no bueno, Fubo takes time to recover. It will recover, but probably not for 6 months. 23 average isn’t bad though, as long as you have three or so month before getting called I think you’ll be fine,
Fubo less like a falling knife and more like a falling guillotine,
Yea I got one yesterday had to sell my crypto. Fubo must have been really rough to hold through this, I’m all in growth stocks too.,
I’d be happy with 72k,
Just do it man, it’s gonna get worse from here,

Congratulations btw,
Sexy.,
mid day spy puts?,
I went from being up $7900 at around 10am to being down $3,000 at market close today. That was a shitty ride. Good job for you!,
Can you even take your money out of RH??,

What have I missed? I'm on fidelity,
The scary part is that they can just change the numbers around with out any consequences,
You know what, I'm just gonna computershare even harder.,
Imagine thinking there’s a brokerage without conflict of interest 🤣🤣

All of these companies exist to turn a profit, and they’re all staffed by people from the financial and banking industries….

That said, fidelity has always done right by me on my accounts. 

The evil you know and trust, over the one that fucks your 400k GME gains into the ground and cancels your sell limit orders early am before market open (looking at you Robinhood),
And they said it was an oops, our bad.   Blame it on fat fingers.  Seriously, We need to start our own trading platform.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I start my job with fidelity next month💀,
Can’t tell if this is bullish or bearish lol,
This community told me to use Fidelity less than a year ago. I didn't want to use anything remotely like RobinHood. What is a good broker?,
Do we know if anyone took advantage of those additional short shares during the mistake?,
#forgetfidelity,
What’s the context?,
Lol I love watching you fucking morons make up stories about some huge conspiracy. Shit like this happens all the time and no one pays attention.,
Hope they get their butts burned in the MoASS!,
Occam’s razor everyone. You really think there’s a shadow cabal so hellbent on making a quick buck off GameStop that they’d go through all these elaborate, nonsensical schemes to get your tiny retail bucks?,
Hello, fellow apes. It is i, yet another fellow ape. Topical, humorous digital images and holding stocks for extended lengths of time, am i right? *All* apes should transfer to a *reliable* ***bro bro bro*** brokerage like *R*robinhood, i-

Welp looks like I'm switching to Robinhood /s,
As if this actually matters?


Some dudes made an error

Once it was corrected it has 0 effect on gme price

**WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK**,
You guys are so fucking stupid. These typos happen all the time but you're watching it morning day and night and it's all some big conspiracy.,
the whole market drops and every retard that thinks gme shouldn't go down with the market blames fidelity lol,
Noooo not the bunny :(,
But can we all agree that the rabbit looks yummy? Right?,
GMED guy now works for Fidelity?,
Discovered it was an error. Only 2m.,
Typo? Nope it's a huge conspiracy. Fucking dipshits,
DRS is the way!,
#COPE,
They're using vibing cat. I fucking love that kitty, they almost ruined it for me,
Fidelity is a major investor of Reddit. Just food for thought.,
That's a Cutco knife! You can tell by the unique ergonomic resin handle. Hard to tell but my guess is the Petite Carver which is a good choice for slaying rabbits,
We should be able to hold our $GME and have absolute control of our shares 🚀🚀🚀,
Horror horror scary granny,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
🤣🙈😂,
So is there gonna be the same play this time around?,
Evidently SOMEONE did…,
I mean, you COULD,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
And Clov,
I know I’m gonna get absolutely admonished for saying this but. Seriously, this could’ve been so much worse. Imagine the trapped shorts saw this? They could’ve plummeted this thing with today’s market move.,
Hold???,
I’m liquidating my Fidelity account putting everything into Robinhood. 
F* Fidelity!,

Meme stock - ✅

Bought high - ✅

Holding heavy bags - ✅

Posting loss porn - ✅


Yep, everything looks to be in order here. Just gotta finish bleeding away that last 35%.,
You got Chamathed.,
Sweet tax write-off!,
Well, almost. You still have some to lose.,
Mmmmmf yeaaa daddy,
Best part of this dip is watching all the shit like WISH, PSFE, CLOV jump off the high dive into a pool with no water.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
I look at your loss porn and my own wounds feel much better. Thank you.,
I bought more today.,
You know, you could maybe sell and roll leaps for the next 20 years and maybe break even.,

You shouldn't hold that very long. Volatility can only stay up for so long. And even if volatility stayed up, the VIX futures would quickly price that in so you'll start losing money anyway. And by that I mean all your gainz will most likely evaporate by tomorrow afternoon.,
Fuck you. Congratulations,
Gay title.. a simple fuck you works wonders, just saying.,
I hear what your saying about not selling. But also maybe take profit to break even or double up then let the rest ride? Gotta keep the game going just in case. Not financial advice. Just speaking as someone who missed multiple opportunities to take profit on winning bets that turned too quickly.,
Nice. I only have 5.,
Congrats you are one of very few that has won the UVXY lottery. Just be careful holding that for too long.,
When u selling?,
Get some of your tendies and use them to charge your phone!,
I dont see any red, why is it loss?,
RemindMe! 1 day,
Great entry on this UVXY play OP - what’s your rationale behind holding this until expiration? You believe there will be continued weakness in the equities market until end of this week?,

Should have been COCK,
They have block.com already...I need to buy up some edgy one-word domain names,
thats a weird change... block should be a parent company of square, tidal, etc.,
BREAKING: Jack Dorsey changes name to "DADDY BTC",
Thank goodness Cube was taken.,
This definitely has nothing to do with Jack's interest in digital currency /s,
Target changes it to Circles,

Why not CUBE,
Or just created a new umbrella org called Block.,
I worked in a business that usee Square. It's trash of the worst sort. Terrible customer service, terrible design, the sales rep lied about features and costs.

So I assume they are rebranding to mitigate the bad PR because too many people know they suck.,

Hey /u/Dope_Freshness, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Puts because they rely on physical products? I've heard better due diligence from ponzi schemes.,
We purchase from a company call jr286 and branded custom sportswear. The former does non team acceories (headbands, gloves, lanyards etc etc) and the latter does non sideline team apparel, inflatables and bags, both for Nike (nike lecenses them to produce this stuff) both have had backlog orders since summer. We have about 10000 backpacks for about 60 different college teams that have have had their ship date pushed back every month since agust...

Tl;dr: supply chain is fuqed,
Also, Nike has a divided date for Dec 03. Be careful because you might get assigned,

#Dey took our jobs!,
You're definitely retarded enough for this sub.

The short bus is too big for you.,
Drugs are bad,
You ask me? From 1 to 10. 1 to smart and 10 for stupid as fuck. My answer is 69.,
TLDR: Ape lose bananas, graphs, me wear tin hat, brrrrr,
You are a fucking dumbass. Beautiful Mind schiztophrenic mofo. Simple Sam ass dude. Rain man babbling idiot.,
Market ain't stupid.  It's a manifestation of us.

Think LowRise Jeans, :Pet Rocks, Bell Bottoms, bucket list challenge, Mullets, Cocaine, tulip bulbs, ARM house loans, The Macarena, camry, Flash Mobs.  


(Lemmings),
Participants don’t always make trades for logical reasons… some parties make trades based on what they think other people will make trades on, and so on.

So someone might think the market will react to omicron news, and sell… and if 50 million traders all sell on this premise, then the shits gonna drop.

I don’t think anyone makes INVESTMENT decisions day to day.  If they do, that’s a whole other issue intertwined in all of this.,
This is a stupid post,
Dr. Burry is that you???,
Ionno why people are still crying about manipulation. All that matters is making money.,
You mean people with more money and resources then the general population have an advantage? You may have gotten in Apple at $27 but your wife is also probably getting drilled by the mailman.,
Spy closed at 456
Also the market crashed because there was a positive covid case,
\#irony,
Everything is shorted especially our favorite meme stonks.

For that reason I hodl.,
“Economical crisis”

You ok bro?,
It's alright honey now take your pills.,
Didn’t read your post but to answer your question:  

#very,
We don't use ape around here anymore.,

You have AAPL options expiring this week.,
Buying power $142.,
I don’t understand how you buy literally 1 contract and made that much. Is that good way to buy? Buy 1 contract for a high price but low share cost ?,
totally savage I live to see this shit,
Meh. It's easy being green. Now bone-crushing poverty? That takes BALLS.,
Bet you that shit ain't up no more 😈,
lol, just a casual “Very Cool” after gaining another   6.5k to the ol’ portfolio.,
Finally someone post there gains from Apple,

CDC says first case of Omicron variant in the US, in California, was a fully vaccinated individual and had mild symptoms, which are now improving; was a traveller returning from South Africa on November 22nd.,
This market makes a lot of $$$ but makes very little sense. OPEN THE CASINO!,
morning fuckfaces,
Cmon TSLA break $1200 again,
I know some of you retards have had to deal with this before. Kitty ran away on Saturday and I really can't think about anything else. I took all the steps to increase chances of his return and sitting on my hands waiting here is brutal. How to stop thinking about it? He is an expert hunter so I think he's still kicking as long as he found a warm spot to hunker down during the cold nights,

Some of y'all too invested in Blue vs Red.  This market only cares about Green.  Politics aint sports - its OK to change teams over time to fit your values.  But don't let politics get in the way of making that $$$,

Travel recovering flattening at 70% of pre covid volume. That ain't enough. Margin pressures from labor and fuel cost fucking over what is conventionally a 3-5% margin business.  Billions upon billions of bad debt that could become unservicable in a tight credit market.

Disney a turd because Disney+ has stalled. What did they expect? At some point consumers say fuck this because now they're right back to paying a cable bill again after signing up for so many streaming services due to the balkanization of content.  Fuckin' Fubo is like $70/mo too.  I didn't cut the cord just to pay $100 per mo again to watch TV.  Antenna gets me 40 channels. Free built in channels in the smart TV another 200 channels. Enough free shit on YouTube. Shit, even your local library has free streaming services with shows and movies.,

Lmao first omicron case in USA? Who would have thought... big surprise. Obviously better sell everything smh,
Omicron is just another variant that's gonna save the market crash, FED's gonna postpone it to Feb,
PLTR now below $20 🤡,
Europe closed green, and USA fucks it up,
i get high growth tanking

but i’ve got a whole watchlist of stocks with huge cash flows and massive margins still getting hammered day in and day out


instead this market just goes “i think i’ll buy AAPL”,
Omarion is priced in,
Easy money for anyone willing to buy Tesla calls. It’ll be back to 1160 tomorrow morning.,
so how the fuck did the market go down before news of Omicron in Cali even surfaced,

Hey GME gang, how’s that negative beta treating you?,
STOP THE COUNT!!!,
I bought my first spy put and I’m not proud of it,
Gonna be more blood tomorrow. Bloody Thursdays are back,
Whoever had the stones to buy 0dte 460p’s got paid off… easily 30-60x my god,
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if a million voices cried "bears r fuk" and were suddenly silenced.,
I guess we’re all gonna die. Cool.,
fuck it, I’m holding all of my calls overnight. I’m not gonna get weeded out,
Isn’t this dump a total overreaction?,
This last 10 minutes will either be the eye of the hurricane or an absolute bloodbath.,
it's hilarious how zerohedge starts to get bullish on twitter then this happens

the true contrarian indicator is when permabears get bullish,
Guys it looks like AMC is about to short squeeze!,

Did you fall for the thanksgiving travel meme?,
Should have went with Omicron Airlines,
F 


Sorry to see it.,
Retarded move. Welcome to fuck city,
There's still a chance ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Done fucked up,
Time to double down, can’t go much lower right?,
Just bought delta $36 June calls end of day today. 🔒,
F,
ROPE,
You stayed in this position???,
Just bought my JBLU call for $14 for June of next year. God speed,
Soon to be down 100%,
You still have 16 days .. fucking RELAXxxxx !,
Airlines will be a solid play, especially the more financially sound ones like Alaska (ALK), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) but buy as a low common stock, not an option. ALK is a $60 stock on an okay day and a 90$ stock when things are rolling. Long play for these, but buy commons now.,
There's a number you can call for gambling addiction.,
Total fucking dynbass hahaha,
I know stocks only go up - but airline options are like used toilet paper. I'm sure there's someone in the world who would like to buy them from you - but the odds of finding that person are very, very low.,
I don’t feel bad,
I bought airline leaps back in March when people were getting vaccinated and it seemed traveling was opening up again.

Boy, people really suck.,
I’ll be ~~praying~~ doing nothing for you.,

Bought $20,000 of Alibaba at $165 recently and had a nightmare about it, literally woke up in the middle of the night and put a sell order from bed. 

Sold at $168 same week and never ignoring another fucking nightmare.,
One thing I never understood…if they de-list they have to buy back the shares from the shareholders. So wouldn’t there be a tender offer with a premium to current prices before a delisting happens?,
Lmao the rain just keeps coming,
Papa Xi: hold my bear.,
This Is fake, the Chinese refuted it officially,
I believe this  is old news and only affects new companies. Old companies still up in the air.,

Nah if you would have held the market would have recovered, you are single handedly responsible for the crash,
🌈 🐻 get what they deserve,
You only gonna lose less than $100 if it expire worthless. Why wouldnt you risk it? You Really belong here,
Lol damn. Long 🐻 plays are crazy though. I've day traded puts last 3 days and don't have the nerve to hold overnight. Lot of after close shenanigans lately.,
You are whining about 2 lots?,
Dumbass. At least is was poor person amounts of money, and a good teaching aid hopefully.,
You call this a loss? Pathetic,
Hindsight 20/20 bro. I left $12k on the table today,
I did that with Tesla calls I bought for $200 last year before the s&p announcement except they ended up being like $8k,
Sooooo calls tomorrow?,
Been there before. Only sell 1 next time and let the other ride if you're trying to play it a little $safe$,
This is why you a cuck,
A piece? Are we talking about cupcakes here,
If it makes you feel better I got fucked out of buying 455p today by my shitty app.  Went to buy near open at the top  but since it wasn't near the money when I press the show all options button the app like lags to shit and stops working. So I wasn't able to buy them,
I did the same. And did the same with uvxy calls this morning. But I hate money so I'm pretty happy rn,
yea yea. stop crying over 1k it’s embarrassing,
u missed out on 1,000 relax I wipe my ass with a thou,

My man actually entered in a clear downtrend, at the peak of a lower high with zero risk management, and held deep into all time lows

Omicron aint shit,
PTON ain't shit,
isn't PTON getting sued by lulu?,
I laughed at it at $100+ a share, love it at this price. The well-off in this country are well-off. The never-ending pandemic has made at-home exercise a much much bigger market than it was and that's going nowhere. People need motivation (hot fit scantily clad instructors) and ease (10, 15, 20 min massive archive of sessions) to exercise. And the well-off will pay for that motivation and ease. Their equipment is great, their platform is scalable, and I see them being able to go downstream to grow their subscription base.,
I have no problem with PTON but what makes you think Ommicron will make people buy PTON who didn’t the first time?  I think it can be a good stock but I don’t think it’s going to moon on Omnicron fears.,
PTON is an amazing stock, and you can bet your bottom dollar Im waiting for it to get froggy,
Peloton is super undervalued at the moment. I built out a 5 year DCF with the following revenue growth curve and arrived at a $75 price target. 

2021: 12% (in line with their guidance, rough year with supply chain issues and sales drop because of prior years growth). 

2022: 41%

2023: 41%

2024: 32%

2025: 32%

Long Run Growth Rate: 3%

It's not hard to imagine PTON hitting these growth projections when you consider that they've still got room to grow in their existing markets Canada, US, UK, and Germany. And they haven't started selling to the entire rest of the world yet.,
I wonder if someday investors will figure out what every fitness gadget maker always figures out, fitness is 5% a legitimate market, and 95% a fad.,
I think you failed to realize that COVID related gains on peloton have already been priced in for over a year.,
Don't use COVID scare tactics to try and pump your shit investment. Fucking retard.,
They are failing and failing fast. Over spent on advertising and reduced prices and layed off tons of people. Failed business model and not a long term product,
I’d rather buy stonks on ShakeWeights…,
Why not TDOC?,
Stationary bikes throughout history are a bad investment.  PTON coming to a yard sale near you,
I’m waiting for PTON to go up for no reason again to get a chance to buy puts because it’s such a shitty business that is just a fad.  They’ll get rocked by Facebook when they get into connected fitness.,
Good god no,
Your positions are shit and rightly so because you invested in an overpriced stationary bike.,
PTON 💩. Can’t trust their management to execute at this point.,

Donkey Kong has turned into Dicked Kuks,
Dkng has absolutely destroyed my ass. I’d cry but it’s actually funny how bad it’s gone down.,
Finally dumped my gambling stock today. Painful 5 digit loss but I couldn’t take the beating any longer. Probably sold at the bottom too,
I’ll buy it WHEN it hits the mid $20s,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) it happens, don't sell now,
i told you not to do that move. this is the result.,
You could’ve went to Hawaii 🏝,
Bought FDs today,
If you buy shares, it isn’t really gambling. Move to LEAPS at a minimum and repost.,
What is the catalyst for this. Pain,

I know a way to turn that into 300 bucks,
Show them closed out. You don’t make it until it’s closed,
Well, not to brag, but I turned 42k into 2k in a week. 😎,
Respect. A lot of times I made fun of the guys that got destroyed on SPY puts so I have to congratulate you on this.,
Fuck you and your fucking puts!!!

Well done,
Congrats and FUCK YOU!,
Now turn 43k into 1mil. Lol!,
Stop while ur ahead dude,
Bunch of malarkey click bait . Where is your initial deposit screen shot , where is your close out shot . It’s nothing but unrealized gain crap. Where is the time line .,
I turned 2k into 1k,
Teach me master!,
Anyone can do this, the hard part is loosing it all..,
Nice job and EAT MY BOOTY!,
Found Pelosi's account,
Well done! Great trades,
Now show us all the other times you lost your balls buying weekly SPY puts. Will wait,
Let me tell you from experience the journey back down to $2k is where men are made !,
How do some of you people do that?,
Holy moly. Impressive sir!,
I think this account is fake. Your name literally has the word gain in it, you use emojis, and you're actually winning as a wsb user. 100% fake to give apes hope.,
Should have sold that today. Take that massive gain and run. Never know what tomorrow will be, especially if the world wakes up to the fact that the new variant is literally as bad as a cold...,
TDA is the goat brokerage obvs,
I call complete steaming horse shit.

SPY only moved 18 points from top to bottom in 6 trading days. So even if you bought barely ITM 473 Puts (at the absolute top) you'd only make 250% return.

Even if Vega 2x, which it didn't, you'd barely break 500% return.

Uttery fake bullshit, this guy should be shunned from WSB forever.,
Nice! Now manage your risk and keep those gains. Consistency is key. Don’t be back at 2K in January.,
Congrats. Next time Powell or yellen speak I'm going to make sure to have some puts as well,
In the zone, congratulations focker!,
You never diamond hand large option gains especially on SPY.,
I wish I understood how to do that 🤦🏽‍♂️,
now turn it back into 2k,
Fuck off - and congrats,
I get inspired by these stories then I just cut my portfolio in half 💼

That’s some serious damage! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Congrats, you are the one winner who made money out of 11million of us. Now let me fk your wife.,
Im always curious how this strategy works in the long run. Like are you down $100k this month from buying puts and you are up $43k this week?,
hope this tard sold,
That’s pretty cool. I went 2k to 500 this week,
bruh, one mistake with those fagget's delight and youll get totally fucked lol.,
Uncle Sam is gonna love you,
amazing bet timing.,
Well done OP. How does this all work? You buy a particular share and hold it and see how it is doing?,
Please teach me your ways,
Damn I need to learn options trading soon,
HAD A COLONOSCOPY LATELY...,
How many BJ's did u give?,
Normally I do the exactly opposite,
Never been more jealous.,
Now just do it a bunch more times!,
Hello FBI, I found Epstein’s accountant,
How? Can you teach us? All from SPY weeklies?,
understand you essentially won a lottery. 61% of s&p weeks are positive. gtfo,
don’t blow it all in one place…or do,
Sweet! Congratulations! 🍾,
Ugh fuck off and congrats,
How?,
Wow,
Loss porn only,
Do it again,
Nice job man!,
Nice. I'm happy I bought 2 puts on bby and. Made 400 do far. Shorting it.,
bruh I been sitting wit my 3k investment for a couple months 🤣,
What did you invest in?,
That would change my life forever how tf do people do this,
Can someone explain how this worked?,
One day I'm gonna be like you guys,
Nice.  How many times did you have buy SPY puts before this worked?,
How can I become a legend like with Simone hand 🤌💎✋💎 lol 😂😂,
And let me take a lucky guess, you didn't sell...,
Dude,
First hit is free,
Lottery ticket,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
🏳️‍🌈🐻,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Nice can i has some,
Sounds low risk sign me up.,
Grats! Great bet.

For now.,
Motherfucker had a 50/50 chance on each option and got it right 3 times.,
i turned 2k into 40k ZWL in three days. catch me if you can,
Fuck you OP,
This says Nov 26?? Is that not the expiration?,
Good. Now sell it and enjoy a lifelong story-tell story with a happy end.,
Given the timing, you should probably set something aside for taxes; last you want to do is to lose it all in January and then still have to pay tax on 40k of gains.,
Roll it all back into more puts,
Feels very much like the kind of bravado that leads to bigger risk taking and eventually a huge fuck up,
What is all this? Can you give me some key words to look into?,
Well I can turn that 43k to $2 in 2 hours .,
Betting against the market, that is a bold move.,
🌈🐻,
How,
I just want to know how.,
I’m literally only trading spy options from now on,
XD i dont understand how,
He will get too bold and fuck it up watch,
Can I have some please uwu,
How?,
I need this type of luck.,
this was supposed to be me turned 2k to 8 then made stupid decisions.. congrats !,
Don't let em have it back!,
Lol this dude happy about his paper trade,
I hope you will need to pay a shitload of taxes.

You should go to the red numbers, then you will have my admiration.,
Kick ass. Take all but 26k out so you can keep day trading. Set aside half the rest for taxes. Rinse and repeat.,
How to make $43k.   Spend $56k. 🤷‍♂️.,
did you drink the missing 37k already?,
meh, I could do worse,
I could turn that 43k into -120k,
Gratz. I ended up with a 4000% increase put today.. ofc I sold at 500% and only invested $60 to start -.- 

Hoping for 2 green dildos tomorrow and Friday as I do have a couple thousand riding on calls.,
I did the exact opposite of this,
Stay tuned! How i turned 43k  to a full time job.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),

Bullshit!!!,
Remember how much is going to be the governments tendies and buy some of your own Wendy's,
Serious question. Given the current state of the market, more specifically SPY...I want to get in a little heavier than I am. Holding around 22k in shares of SPY, still up around 15% on those shares overall. Have a few 500 jan2023 calls that I'm down about 10% on after today. If I were to sell off around 5k worth of shares and reinvest that into shorter dated calls, what would you reccomend? All on the same expiry or broken up on different exp dates? Any insight is appreciated, looking for good swings not playing weeklys.,
What trading app is this?,
Theres going to be so much SPY gains porn end of the year it’s ridiculous,
Huge risk going all in on spy calls imo. Extremely uncertain going forward. One bad news day could drop your holding by half dude,
Fuck you asshole,
Don’t buy options guys, they control the supply, if u haven’t learned that by now, ur deserves to lose money,
Basically “I gambled and could have lost more money than I own, but I got lucky this week”,
HA thats NOTHING,

I turned a mid size bud of sour diesel

into ONE blunt and ten bong hits!!

sometimes I impress myself a lil too much!,

If someone could explain why apple was up to me that would be great,
This was literally me watching Apple rise why I watched my spy fall.,
It's crazy. Only AAPL and TSLA are green in my portfolio.,
Meanwhile, TSLA just barely crossed the line,
I dumped my AAPL positions for more shares in AMD and NVDA. I'm starting to regret it.,
So I bought some SPY 500 JAN2023 leaps at the bottom today...

My thought, SPY average annual return is 10% right??
But last year was like a 25% return with covid...so maybe I'm on the back end of that average :0

Whatever stocks go up right?,
That moment I understand all my portfolio is 100% Apple calls.,
Timoooooothyyy cooooook,
AAPL the only thing in my portfolio to ever be green.,
What a day bois and holy shit thank you Omicron for the steep discounts on AAPL on Friday, bought all I could. Thank you lawd.,
Waiti til Apple implodes on earnings next quarter. This whole runup on a long dumb car rumor is a little crazy for a 2.5T company,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I got $55K on $AAPL and $MSFT Jan 2024 Calls. Plan on selling then Nov 2022, hopefully I can like 5x-10x my money?,
In 2 year it will be Tesla leading :)),

I blew my wife’s boyfriend as a Christmas present.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Yeah, I bought some PayPal.,
I bought the family Xmas presents using my PayPal money,
Didn’t have any money left,
PYPL is fucking me so hard right now I don't know whether to cry or give in and enjoy the ride.,
I own some PYPL 2023 calls that are down like 80%, so I can't give any gifts this year.,
my wife's boyfriend name is Paypal,
Call my wife on paypal.

She declined.

What does it tell you? That he has her PUTS already...,
Oh snap,
What are your red and green moving averages? Hull or jurik?,
The pre-pandemic high was ~$120, long ways to go still,
The mother of all sell signals according to this TA. Get some shorts on this boys.,
What do the lines mean?,
Do you guys have holdings for PYPL?,

Ok, but what's their margins looking like?,
YOLO!,
Good news, hoping the markets will finally react positively,
I always wonder what’s the projected revenue of Tesla without access to the Chinese market.

I bet most China doomsday prophets are heavily invested in Tesla without accounting for it‘s own dependence on China.

In short: China doomsday prophets are either exaggerating or are disingenuous.,
It’s been a busy quarter for Nio’s ~~chef~~ account.,
If NIO was a 🇺🇸 USA Corp.  Probably they stock price will be around $100 or more but be a Chinese Corp thats the -con of that stock that China government 🇨🇳,
Happy to see these numbers. 🚀🚀🚀,
In this market this chinese EV calls/stock may pay off good. They are not really following S&P or other US growth sticks. I had calls on XPeng, Li and Nio, seems to be will be a green day today and days to come in this volatile market.,
NIO will always be the Android to the Iphone of EV cars TSLA.,
still a china company? i'm good.....,
No More China stocks for me,
Yawn let me know when they start delivering to the US,
That is slow 🐌 growth for the 1.4 billion CCP investment. Interesting to see what the ccp does.,
It's China made and with the current conflict China is instigating, it may have a difficult time getting the end game of real growth like the Tesla.  So far this year, 2021, Tesla has delivered 241,300 vehicles.

So NIO is scratching only 5% of what Tesla produces and delivers.  Tesla doesn't have oversea shipping costs.  NIO has no reliability record yet, NIO has no Space X.,
Still investing in Chinese companies?,
Nio did not manufacture not even 1,
I just hope it reaches $50 by Nio Day,
Xpev and Li delivered more, that’s why it won’t be a good news,
NIO is also in China so …,
China also announced it is going to stop the loophole allowing baba and nio to be traded outside China, so you might want to hold your breath on this.,
Lucid had 17000 reservations so suck it,
Spam,
NOOOBODY cares. NIO is not a tech company. Nobody cares about making a bunch of cars, otherwise we would be buy FORD and GM.

LCID 500mile range, 1000hp that's tech

TSLA FSD that's tech

NIO = garbage

GGPI = garbage,
F**k NIO. Turned my LEAPS into weeklies , stagnant POS,
NIO is good company but remember it’s under CCP ruling so better to avoid😊,

Now if they can do that for the next 6 years it will justify todays valuation.,
So they say lol,
Sweet, let me know when I can buy actual shares that aren't part of a Cayman VIE that will evaporate the moment someone shits in Pooh's Cheerios.,

Shorting spy? Did we just become best friends?,
Very similar gamble to mine, except I use Calls and Puts various  short expiry date and ride the momentum. Only thing keeping me green the last two weeks.,
More precisely, put a stop loss order in once you are up.  Never let a winning option contract turn into a loser.,
You and I are in a similar spot rn.,
? What's up with the after hour fluctuations? Got me on a Rollercoaster here! Looking good then market opens and bam it goes down hella! What's up with that?,
Are you selling at open?,
It's a fun meme because we all know what an amazing trader she is....  If y'all can bash the "investor" and leave the politics out of it, I'll keep it up.

Edit: welcome r/all to our gloryhole.  Please observe the no politics sign:

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259),
Does seem awfully suspicious. All sunshine, rainbows, and "inflation is transitory" right up until after he gets another term in the Fed. Then all of a sudden, "this is your captain speaking... yah, shit's fucked"

Can't money machine go brrrrr forever I guess.,
My SPY calls drilling hard. Fuck me,
Dead ass, this dude went from pumping my portfolio to a sea of red in seconds lmao,
She has the best trading record in history except for the person who turned 8k into 5b with ETH to SHIB.  We all know she time the market perfectly and switched to puts on 11/22, this meme should have been labeled "JP when is your Money Printer Go BRRRR announcement going to happen? so i can swing back into Calls",
Love that the aide to Nancy's right is checking WSB for what to do next.,
What did Powell do?,
Powell, you're not allowed to ruin the economy AND my portfolio. One or the other, please.,
She still up more than 69% YTD,
Pelo is fucking livid. Settin up hits on opps as we speak.,
You know they sold all their calls yesterday.,
Cheers to assuming she had calls, probably took out a huge put position with the insider info she gets.,
"Jerry, it's me P Shizzle.  Look, momma needs a new pair of shoes and I have some cash I wanna drop in.  I'm gonna need your ass to tank the market for a bit so I buy low. You're a fucking doll.  Gam-gam out!",
That's not a Jitterbug flip,
Is it me or is that a really strange way to hold a phone,
What happened?,
"After everything I've done for him.  To think I let him *defile* me!,
Enough of this shit. Cathie woods for speaker of the house. Get the market sorted out.,
When j powel pulls out its like his dick grips the markets vagina and yanks it out too, ie the sea of red(right?). This man should not be allowed to speak during market hours,
I don't know how she does it. She is so good. A string of grand slam calls this past year.,
We need age limits on terms. I swear when I’m Nancy’s age I bet congress will be filled with a bunch of heads in aquariums like futurama,
I can’t wait until her disclosing drops, hasn’t made a trade in months and I bet she’ll have another spousal trade disclosed with puts or sell activity like a month ago lol,
Classic reminder that it’s not timing the market. It’s time in the market. 81 years young. One hand “helping you up.” The other in your pocket.,
The wolf of Wall Street,
her roblox stock is printing.,
why haven't you idiots put all your money into tsla already.  that shit is everything proof.,
FUCK NANCY!!🤣🤣🤣

TERM LIMITS!!!💯,
Fancy Nancy getting Antsy 🐜,
When Nancy realizes her money printer is working in reverse,
She bought so long before it became public info that she probably didn't even realize the market dropped today,
Wait until it gets disclosed that her husband loaded up on puts yesterday,
she is a GILF, not gonna lie 

Nancy if you're reading this hit me up I am free on the weekends :),
It’s funny how nobody else mentions Richard Burr, Kelly Loeffler, Jim Inhofe, Dianne Feinstein, David Perdue, John Hoeven. It’s almost like selective “outrage” 🥱🥱,
That’s one evil 2 faced bitch right there,
She’s such a piece of shit,
Basic question - is this bringing the market down or up ?,
Why does the phone look like a brick in her hands….🧱,
They are both checking that her rebalance went through before the news went public.,
Fake news. We all know she bought puts this morning,
$DWAC,
>Nancy is frustrated

Fuck Nancy, I'm frustrated. I'm holding 3x leveraged crude oil down like 30% since Thanksgiving. At least gas should be getting cheaper I guess. 💀,
Could I ask for an Update/explanation on this? Rather more on the American/what's going on side. 

I have researched a bit on her as I heard about about how she 'somehow' knew what to invest in every time and just managed to be one step ahead of everyone. Almost like she knew what was going to happen before everyone else. 

So I know this bit, but the American politics bit and how she hasn't been asked how exactly does she does it (and why the American people aren't asking why all of Congress how this is allowed).,
why is she not in prison for insider trading ???,
Fuck that evil cunt,
Bottom text should read: "What the f\*ck happened? Insider trader should not be this damn hard!",
Now if this dumpster fire of a lady can give us all the inside info she gets, we can all be rich!  Right???,
Weird looking Boobs.,
I’m thinking Nancy haters are frustrated more then her tho….,
Is she getting chonky from stress eating ice cream?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
the Pelosi memes are hands down my favorite lol,
i wonder how much she paid for her tits,
This "human" got the devil on speedial.,
YES, MOAR PANIC!  Stocks just went on sale again!,
I have my doubts she knows what  calls and puts are, despite her being the "super trader" that she is....  


How do you say our politicians are corrupt with out saying our politicians are corrupt?  
Answer: simply say "life long politician",
Blonde bitch on the left is trading,
**I hope this ghoul gets a WSB style ass pounding but sadly its probably a prolapsed shriveled Porn producer type black hole. Nancy go get yer fancy Eyetalian ice cream you corrupt parasite insider trading cunt.**,
Her apple still green,
Lol,
Haha.,
Just wondering what this meme is about?,
What a joker, nancy priced in this JPow speech before the big bang, so stfu and go buy her FD's,
Everyone calls on spot . Nfa,
Why do retards not buy puts? Stocks only goes up???,
(T)QQQ calls delta 60-70 LEAPs load em up!
SPY ditto.,
I’m so confused,
This group goes from “I’m confident” to “I don’t know what the fuck is going on” in a matter of seconds.,
I feel so bad for her!,
Enough smack talk!  So what are we saying the play is?  I mean that’s why we’re here...,
so Call man Powell is about to be Puts man Powell?,
believe it or not this is what they are doing,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Haha surprise MF! She already had puts on him.,
https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILxciTPMbDlOBwYW.medium,
Is that bitch still alive 😏,
Thank god my last minute Pfe calls I bought got filled...,
ain’t it the truth

u/banano_tipbot 1,
You guys like queso?,
You idiots didn't learn from friday🤦‍♂️,
Someone needs to eat a bottle of gas station boner pills and fuck some sense into this one. I'll show you some inflation.... lol... inflation....,
She's the only frustrated one..? Really..? Market dropped 653 today, I seriously doubt it's just her that may be frustrated but sure...,
What did he do?,
Lmao this shits going tits up,
Nah she's playing Put's that womans got an insane portfolio.,
Fuck her.,
This looks like a scene from Arrested development 








“THERES ALWAYS MONEY IN THE BANANA STAND”,
Lol. Like Nancy loses money in the market.,
So I have someone to blame other than my autistic ass for my account shitting the bed recently?,
Yes but sticks will go even higher because the dollar will be worth less and you will need more money to buy the same stock,
Mortgage pro here. Eff all that shit that happened today.,
All this wishy washy shit is causing too much uncertainty in the market. I'd be more cautious these days, don't go full retard,
What’s her portfolio again?,
We need tips from her which stocks heading to the moon. She is the best investor of all time,
Ngl. Nancy looks looks kinda hot for an old broad. 

I would,
Get better fitting SPANX, Nancy.

Jesus Christ.,
Remember when Alan Greenspan was a 'hero' in media after 08? They gave him person of the year and everything.. I imagine they'll do this for Powell after "saving us" after the next big one..

Hm.,
Her tesla calls are a-ok,
JPow might be giving info to Nacy. I heard him say to her something about "trading inside her".

Not entirely sure what to make of it.,
I'm ok with seeing my portfolio burn if can take that disease-infested slime hag to hell with me,
Where do i find her positions?,
The gandalf of trading, always on time with her trades.,
I'm out of the loop here,
I’m with Nancy.,
you must be a Republican scum,
Mother suckers in here said to me noooo it won’t go red cause of omicron. That was Friday. It’ll be green allll week. How dare you say puts on everything. Boohoo omicron won’t affect me. Boohoo green crayons. Moon moon. Rocket. Blah blah ya stupid ass honkies. I told you puts all week,
I’ll be sure to pray for her. Poor thing. /s,

No way he sold.,
Yeah, if you didn't sell and take those profits you're gonna be an economic failure.,
I don't get it I bought out of the money before and when it got close to being in the money I was still down.  Does it matter if your strike price is deeply out of the money and the share price goes to it but still far from it? Cause I lost alot like that,
Made 200% today. Good work OP. Remember to buy the crash.,

I bought draftkings less than a month ago and am already down 31% worse stock I’ve ever owned. I bought every dip on the way down too.,
I am bag holding with an avg of 53ish. I had position since February 2021 and rode the wave down last spring and up over the late summer. Currently down 41% and today sucked. Especially after watching it bleed daily since the entain announcement in early September (which was dropped over a month ago). CEO has been arguing and saying stupid shit on Twitter. You’d think the stock would be in a bullish phase with the major sports in full swing. Really don’t know what to read into this company anymore but I really don’t have a fucking choice now lol,
Buy GENI,
My life sucks,
DKNG is fucked until big states like California legalize it,
I have a future in DKNG your mom,
I sold my puts too early.  when they got to 4.5x my cost I sold.  Could have made it to 6x cost.,
I ran with EIHDF (888), but I dumped yesterday. I plan on getting back in at some point, maybe in the $2.5-$3 range. Like weed I don’t see much happening in regards to legalization over the next few months.,
Draft king does not do it for me. They have a lot of cash on hand from raises, but I don't see much thats good about them other then that. Maybe in the future, but not today. 

Their last earning reported revenue of 212.82 M. Not bad, however they had a net income of -545M😳 and a net profit margin of -256%.  This is with a 25B$ MC as of right now. 

If you want to buy a nasty dip I would be more inclined to buy PayPal, autodesk, unity software, mercadolibre, visa, teladoc.

Edit, it's not wise to look at the history of a stock price to judge an entry point on a speculative play. That is why we see so much wish porn. There are a lot of value trap companies out there that will violate you behind a wendy's dumpster.,
Too much competition in the space. DKNG has to spend everything to maintain market share.,

🎅🏻 came early this year,
MRNA is revolutionary. I'm bullish on the technology. It's gonna be everywhere in medicine,
FWIW - Moderna's comments on this: ""The recently issued Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruling on the 8,058,069 patent relates to Moderna’s challenge to certain legacy patents held by Arbutus, commenced well before the development of mRNA-1273. These actions were taken by Moderna in response to the longstanding aggressive posture taken by Arbutus and its predecessor company against many developers of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. Through its actions, MRNA successfully overturned one legacy patent held by Arbutus and invalidated the broadest claims of a second one. MRNA’s continued development of its proprietary LNP formulation technology and manufacturing processes have advanced well beyond the technology described in these legacy Arbutus patents. Our improved proprietary LNP formula, used to manufacture mRNA-1273, is not covered by the Arbutus patents. Moderna is not aware of any significant intellectual property impediments for any products we intend to commercialize, including mRNA-1273."",
I really love the sleazy NIH part of that.,

They asked him several questions, one of which was:

    Q: You buy and sell all day. Do you have advice for mom-and-pop investors?

    A: Don’t panic. Hang in there. Take a reasonable profit and do not wait for an unreasonable loss. If you can ring the cash register, do so. But don’t panic when markets go up and down. And if you're a bear, ultimately you're fucked,

 Not all hero’s wear toupees,
What if, and hear me out here, what if he isnt a trader at all and just a model used for his facial expressions so the financial websites and newspapers, which are owned by some pretty nefarious people involved in the stock markets, have pictures like this because they are trying to get emotional reactions out of us, make us buy or sell when they want us to?  I dont believe it to be true as obviously that would be a crazy thing to think.,
Peter?,
The presence of that big dude who has "Prime Executions" written on his back is...ominous. It's like Citadel has hired a hitman organization to ensure things are running smoothly.,

Legend has it that this man is actually Apis, the sacred Greek bull god, having taken mortal form. He fights 5 days per week, only taking off weekends and federal holidays, waging war against the bear demi-gods which threaten humanity's very existence.

Where were you two weeks ago?,
MOAAAAARRRR LOWWWWWERRR ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Just make sure you close that GME short out in the next couple weeks before the cycle begins anew. Ride it down, but be sure to ride it up too. 

As for your AMC position, ride that bitch back down to $7. I still don't see the play there.,

Just buy Tesla, stop this nonsense,
Can we also have a bear case study , Elon nexus metric or some such . Where he shits on Jeff bezos,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
I'm doing some machine learning on data from different companies attempting to find some correlation and one major issue I found so far is I have to correct some of them for Musk but he still would remain an external influence causing stock price to move. 

How the hell am I supposed to account for future or present tweets? Read them through a net crawler and extrapolate companies and contex?

It's like a whole side project.,

It’s a good day to be you.,
Much love,
Shit I forgot I had stocks in this company LOL,
should've played dec calls yesterday. Got out happily with 60% gain on my Jan calls today. 

Gonna re-enter when omicron fear hits once more,
Love this stock. 200 shares at $72 and a $45 6/22 call. We’ll see earnings on 12/20. Hope this does well as I need more crayons.,
Wish I bought more,
It's an old meme Sir, but it checks out.,
I cashed out of MU yesterday with my gains. I'll jump back in after we know what's going on with omni.,
Good enough for a pic,  good enough to sell,

It really has to reach like an extreme where EVERYONE is piled in for the "surprise" flushing.,

Okaaaaay let‘s go,

Should have held this one but I dumped it pre-earnings… was a smart move … for about 5 hours…,

Don’t worry, I buy baba puts tomorrow morning, so you can expect baba to moon,
It aint dead till it gets delisted,
I’m down 200k and don’t know what to do.,
Im with you bro. The night is darkest just before dawn/delisting.,
!remindme 3 years "I think it'll recover just fine, but look back here to remind yourself of when BABA was down 60% from all time high and either celebrate its recovery or commiserate the disappearance of Jack Ma.",
Shoulda put WISH in that meme 🤣🤣🤣,
I'm 54% down...,
U homies want me to finish off BABA and get it delisted just say the word and I'll buy a few shares.,
Unless you're worried about delisting, which is a legitimate risk, this is a value buy.

That said, I aint touching no china stocks.,
Man this is honestly depressing. I don't think people understand BABA is not some small shit stock, we are talking about a FANG cap like company GETTING SLAUGHTERED at -60% a year.

Wars have been started for less.,
Get a grip, its not like $BABA is down 60% this year ... oh, wait a minute ...

Dont worry Warren Buffet has taken a big stake in BABA and he's a value investor, it will be up 7% (seven) from here in 2 years time! 🤡,
Me watching g you have a baba portfolio and not cutting losses,
Is yoloing everything i own into $WISH a solid strategy to make big money ?,
True chads are just starting their positions,
Bought 100 shares at $205 :). Time to sell and put my remaining 11k into something else that loses 50 percent in 4 months!,
Zero is still a ways away,
One stock =portfolio 😂🤪,
Anyone remember that post like 3 months ago of the guy that yolod like 5million in baba and just responded to every comment with a buffett quote like he was the second comings of Munger.,
Looking for my first buy on BABA at 117. Prob will sell poots and use the premium to buy 150 leaps,
down 50k 1600 shares .. 😅,
Stock will obviously rebound some. But question is how long will it take? It probably wont see $200 again any time soon. 2023 at the earliest. And then China will probably invade Taiwan and delist the US shares, removing all of the gains over night. However if you're already in it, its better to hold than sell at 127.,
Best to close out all china position.  I did after watching them get slaughtered by the CCP.,
You can add Zoom & Peloton to that meme as well.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
I will not worry about BABA, share price is down due to politic, I believe the storm will pass,
You were warned,
💎🙏👏👏 because we all know if will go back up,
Talking about a single stock as your “portfolio” says so much.,
I too was once a BABA holder. It doesn't matter if the market is retarded, the market can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent. I got out at $140 after holding from $230. Cut your losses. I'm done touching China plays.,
Down down down under 100 by Christmas,
At this point you have had plenty of notice to get out of that! No one is investing in China businesses. The whole thing is a dictatorship where they just rule by decree. No recourse through the courts and then can rug pull you any time. Literally might as well put it in meme internet money. That said, Baba sure is cheap….,
BABA ain’t dead. Did anything fundamentally change about the company? If not, then hold. This of course is assuming you knew the risks coming in.,
This is quality content ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Now I am thinking of loading some, may be I can make few bucks as all of you try to short it tomorrow,
I learned after the whole Luckin Coffee fiasco to never buy chinese stocks.,
China killed baba,
“Let’s screw all those dumb capitalist pig and get their money. Those idiots don’t even realize those ADRs aren’t worth shit.” -overheard in Beijing at national CCP convention.,
Tis crazy,
This is why I have puts.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
it broke 2018 lows today :(,
not gonna touch baba ever.

&#x200B;

wondering what happened to this guy - https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzt79h/21\_million\_alibaba\_call\_options\_increased/,
What did Alibaba do too lose so much share value?,
The crowd in the back is me watching wish bag holders get molested,
I think it's time I bought baba, been watching it bleed for a long time. Perhaps I'll buy cqqq or xpp?,
HA HA,
Fml,
PLTR too,
Y u no grow my Baba? 🪙💰💸🥄,
Lost $3,700. I had to bounce. I couldn't take the pain any longer. Put it all in Navitas Semiconductors,
I think they just said that they dont want to ban VIE. Thats good,

still too expensive, trading at multiples of revenue,
zynga has never moved up for some reason ever.  
buy it when it moves,
Robinhood Gold say buy, so probably mid-crash. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Trash,
Puts are in order,
I didn’t think Zynga was still around. Do they still make those flash games?,

$TSLA will trade up 60% today based on this horrible news,
Go public, I'll buy some space x stocks :),
How can they go bankrupt? The government will just give them more of the plebs money.,
My heart breaks for the worlds richest man,
Not happening. It's his way of telling the workers to work harder. They have too many funding options to go bankrupt.,
Seeing as how they help throw 🇺🇸 assets into space, this is a nothing burger.  Space X ain’t going anywhere.  When it goes public, literally 📈🚀🌕[Mars emoji]
He said the same thing about $TSLA, that did ✅,
About time,
Thoughts and prayers,
Sometimes you gotta go bankrupt before you can make $$$ just look at Siers in the past month,
SpaceX will go under the Starlink company name ticker.,
Why do people post links to paywalled articles without quoting at least parts of the text?,
$SCEX ftw!,
HURRY UP AND IPO SO I CAN BUY THE FUCK OUT OF YOU,

You never have to pay taxes if you never make money.  Thanks, WSB.,
After the last week, I don't need to worry about the IRS.  Unrealized losses have been realized.,
Wait you guys pay taxes?,
Fuck that, tax harvesting my losses like a true ‘tard,
Nudes please,

You are supposed to snort coke once or twice but this retard is swimming in it.,
What a jabroni,
How much u think Moderna and Pfzizzer paid this schmuck to say this,
S&W? I think he has reached his breaking point, this MF’r seriously wants to shoot people 🤣,
I don't even listen to this fucker, but I know 100% that he's a piece of shit totalitarian...,
This only works if you have sucessfully taken guns away from private citizens.

Source: australia,
Idk who listens to Cramer tbh, his stock picks consistently underperforms the market over the long term from what I’ve read, his bumps are just because the people watching him buy it after he says to…,
They have to get this fucking moronic idiot off the air. Can we please get a email campaign together to cnbc to get this ass clown off the air.  I wish I could bloomberg but don't have it in my lineup,
I could be wrong, usually am. Is it in anyone's head that the omicron variant is a weaker form of it due to herd immunity? Essentially knocked it down a ring or two. Now allll the big wigs want a final push on FUD(stock related and not) cause they know leverage is soon gone with this pandemic s@#$?,
Imagine seeing all this and not aping into https://www.unvaxxedsperm.io/,
Fuck this Nazi!,
Jesus Christ what a fucking clown.,
Unvaxxed sperm is the next bitcoin,
last time i checked jimmy chill wasn't the guy in charge of that,
Fuck cramer,
It’s unconstitutional.,
Guy’s a nazi. 😧,
bear stearns is fine! \~ shouted in a Kermit the Frog on coke voice,
You had me at coke rat ❄️🐀,
He's actually in favor of government forced medical procedures,I wonder if he knows how stupid he sounds?,
“We need to make this happen by, say, January 1st”

Someone has calls for Jan 2 lmao,
This is getting weird.  

For those who don’t know: typically viruses evolve to be more infectious but less harmful.  The omicron variant will (likely) be the least deadly variant so far.,
I didn't think I could possibly care any less about the covid vaccines. I was wrong. I ACTUALLY care less now,
Ironic a Wall Street capital guy is actually A fucking communist at heart and doesn’t even know he is one…

Fuck him and CNBC.,
While we’re on the topic, $SWBI has an ultra low P/E ratio. Just saying.,
I turned it off when he compared the casualties of the civil war to covid lmao,
Man, that guy is dark. There’s children dreaming of Christmas, Santa Claus, snowmen, and love. He’s wanting Holodomor, Khmer Rouge, systematic persecution. The world needs to watch Schindler's List over the holidays.,
Isolation may actually extend the problem. If the reports of this new variant are true, and it is more transmissible but much less severe, then that means the normal life cycle of an evolving virus is finally starting to attenuate its lethality. This could actually be a long term good thing. The issue is for the benefit to spread, and the attenuation to continue, the virus must continue to spread. Prior lockdowns did almost nothing to halt the worldwide spread so what is needed is more time and less panic.,
As macabre as this is, there is another school shooting, Dem kinda control the house, senate, and POTUS.  Gun control FOMO is a real thing as I have traded SWBI on sentiment over and over.  If there is a hard push for restrictions, ones that would be locked up at SCOTUS for a good time, we are gonna see people want to get their guns.


That said they can't even keep them in stock, but have a P/E of like 4.  I just bought a chunk of commons, but that 25 strike price doesn't look bad for a few weeks out?  But you all do you!,
I am so sick of this guy. He is throwing around the word mandate like... idk what. Wish i had a good analogy. But def bought and paid for or the CCP has got their hooks in him. But yeah, more likely Moderna, Pfizer, and whoever is running the country these days. Can you spell totalitarian? Get him off the air. Oh wait, cnbc is just part of nbc... never mind,
Military guy here: There is no combination of words in the English language to explain to anyone, of any level of intelligence, how very awful this idea is. Fuck no. 

1.) Stop treating the military as if we're the only part of the government that can get anything done. We're not; and I'd point out there is a level of accepted fiscal inefficiency within the military that would be unacceptable in any organization that was not dedicated to killing people. We try, man, but doing what we do *effectively* does not guarantee *efficiency*. 

2.) Why in the absolute fuck would you want the military to run public health? We have half as many doctors as we need, undertreatment and misdiagnosis is simply accepted, Tricare is free but you have to spend time ramming things through them to get an acceptable level of care -- what the fuck have we done to earn this kind of trust from anyone?

3.) The "Hearts and Minds" campaign is the carrot half of the Iraq/Afghanistan war; the Stick part of that is that we are usually allowed to kill people who are determined to be threats. Bro. Please, for the love of God, stop talking about using the fucking *military* in the United States. ***WE KILL PEOPLE***. Stop pounding this square peg into round holes.,
You mean our military which still has a moderate portion unwilling to get vaccinated and are directly disobeying direct orders? Will never happen.,
A friend of mine did three tours in Afghanistan.  When you ship out you receive up to 17 different vaccines, depending on where you're going.  

This is absolutely nothing new.  And people trying to make the "mRNA vaccines are a new technology" argument have no idea what they're talking about.

Kramer is a bald asshole for sure, but he's not wrong here.

Edit:  I’m retarded.  I interpreted this as Kramer suggesting military members should be vaccinated.

Using the military to force citizen vaccinations is outrageous, regardless of whether or not I believe everyone should be.,
Until scientists admit natural immunity is a thing, I will continue to call bullshit on mandates.,
The military doesn’t even want a vaccine mandate…,
Actually, it's a great idea. Covid ain't gonna die off on its own.,

Too bad Colt supplies all the rifles,
I thought I couldn'y hate him more.,
Someone kick him in the nuts,
Didn’t realize I shared so many sentiments with y’all,
Ur gonna get the group ppl who are against this shit to go door to door and make ppl take it…. Good luck,
The difference between polio and covid is that 98% of people that got covid (a bad flu) survives. Also, majority of deaths are people over 70 years old. Cramer is an idiot.,
Imagine seeing all this and not aping into https://www.unvaxxedsperm.io/,
How cool would it be if they made guns that shot the vaccine and it became like a hunt. We could charge people a few to hunt the unvaccinated. It’s not murder so I assume it’s at the very least a legal grey area,
I heard this story once about a tea party in Boston the last time someone tried to tell Americans what to do.,
I mean if most of y’all got the vaccine, we woulda had a normal market. Ape cause problem then ape cry about problem,
This is important. If the people are too dumb or selfish to do whats best for the community, the community will do whats best for them,
Is it just me, or is he obviously drunk?,
Knowing how corporate is from working there, they are incapable of even aiming straight.,
Lol this title make me snort and giggle on the toilet and it woke up my wife,
this Jim Cramer? https://www.tipranks.com/insiders/james-cramer,
I think Jim had a stroke a while back. Seems to slur his words badly.,
Chrome Dome has always been a retarded coke head. Now he’s just showing his ass to the Dems’ in hope that they make JPow turn the money printer back on so he can be half-correct about whatever dumb ass market theories he has.,
I heard he had the vaccine injected into his butthole for the first dose and his peehole for the booster,
PUTS on ATF agents,
Just more evidence that the government can work fast.. most of the time they just choose not to,
I signed up for his email club (free) and he said to invest in PayPal right before it crashed 😂,
Smith doesn't supply weapons to the military,
Just more paid content. Wouldn't worry,
The vaccine does not stop the spread of covid. What a fucking dope.,
How are people still suggesting vaccine mandates to "end" a pandemic? When the vaccine has been proven to not work with 100% efficacy, break through cases, immunity wades over time, and more and more variants popping up therefore rendering any previous vaccine useless to any other strain. The autism is unreal. Ate they this stupid? Or just paid to say things.,
I hate it when I agree with him.,
I just don’t see a good earnings report.  They had issues last quarter with supplies and were at an all time high earlier this year.  What is the catalyst for it reversing a downtrend now?,
The cramer clown missed the November 9th CDC data drop that 146milliom have had the virus and 99% survived. Must have missed the data on natural immunity from VARIOUS countries. 
He should be taken off tv for being un-american. Get the temper tantrum clown off tv……..
He is the true toxic virus.,
Fuck this cuck,

Sweet this should make the stock pop another 60%,
I would bet over 50% of people with trucks don't know how to pull a trailer.,
Rivian truck is for young suburban tech nerds, not people who actually need a truck.,
Isn't that roughly the same as a gas powered truck?,
Wait, economy decreases when you tow heavy things? The hell you say!!,
hell... even the people who own trucks hardly tow. Have you been to Texas. Every want to be cowboy here has trucks... that they cant drive.... much less tow anything.,
You lose fuel efficiency and mileage with any truck towing a load, and the whole point of a truck is the bed, not the ability to tow, which suvs also do well. 

If a vehicle marketed to tow large loads lost that much battery, that would be bad. But this truck is obviously meant for carrying dressers from the estate sale to your cookie cutter in Sacramento. Ain’t no one pulling a horse trailer or moving a u haul in an electric vehicle in 2021,
My f150 goes from 20mpg to 8 or 9 when towing a 22ft. rv. This is normal, Tesla suv range also tanks when towing.,
The stock is massively overvalued, so don't take me as some Rivian shill because I'd dump that in a heartbeat.  But if you're concerned about towing 5,000 lbs across the country on a regular basis, that's not what this truck is for.  What article is next, how Corvettes are garbage because a Camry can carry 2x as many people?

Most truck owners drive without a load the majority of the time, and when they do it's their kid's dorm furniture, 2x4's, or maybe some Home Depot shrubs.  Not 5,000 lbs thousands of miles.,
Wait....
  you mean if you tow something behind your vehicle it's fuel economy decreases!!

Oh my God who could have possibly known that exvept every f****** person who has ever towed anything ever....

How is this a surprise?,
Just live on top of a mountain. Coast down the mountain when you tow stuff. Get a tow truck to bring you back to your house.,
These trucks are meant for most of the truck owners on the road today who use them solely to commute. Not for the people who actually use trucks for work and hauling.,
The only reason I own a truck is to make my micropeen look bigger. I only ever use the truck to go to Wendy’s or the beer store.,
The point of having a truck is twofold. It firstly increase dick size and secondly turns the other guy into your crumple zone.,
I had a 2007 tundra . That thing completely drank fuel when I would tow my trailer to the racetrack . I normally got 600km to a tank and after towing I couldn't imagine i would get past 350. I know that's not 62% but towing does effect range quite a bit,
Nikola down hill range!,
Classic FUD article similar to ones about Tesla when it was first starting,
Diesel 2020 f350 towing 16k lbs fuel range 210 miles.. Refueling time 4 minutes, no real serious person trying to make money with a Truck is willing to sit for hrs to charge a battery..,
Most people with trucks haven't towed shit,
For those if you who dont have pickups or do but don't haul anything... Whenever I have a trailer hooked up with any kind of decent load my mpg is cut in half. 

The only pickups that don't suffer from this are diesels, which still get worse mpg when hauling, it's just not such a substantial drop, maybe 30% depending on the load. But they also aren't as fuel efficient as gas engines. 

In summery, a 62% drop is somewhat expected from anyone who uses Thier pickup for towing. But anyone who does consistent towing knows not to get an electric vehicle.,
My heavy duty drops from 23 mpg to 12 when I’m towing on the highway,
Most trucks A point, not THE point, is towing. 

Rivian isnt aiming for that cohort... seems obvious,
It’s electric, it’s to be expected.  Besides you see range reduction in gas engines when towing as well.,
Well it’s electric, so that’s that,
Somebody is trying to FUD looking for a lower entry.....,
I know nothing about electric vehicles, but attaching a big battery underneath or inside the trailer with a hardwire hookup to the truck for a larger capacity to make up the difference doesn't seem out of the realm of practicality,
Tesla fruitbois obviously don’t know shit about towing. The range lost is about the same for a gas truck. Stop FUD.,
Have you tried hooking up a trailer to your gas or diesel truck? Lol obviously the fuckers get less range weighted down. If your fat AF, guess how far you’ll go compared to a twig.,
Real trucks come equipped with a Hummin Cummins!!! They also [Roll Coal](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBme7klem3_R_YSQMJymMo3DdCb6trEzOWdw&usqp=CAU)!,
Simple solution, just tow a big ass solar panel.  Unlimited range.,
My 05 Dodge Dakota hasn't towed, but I bought it 3 years ago and it's paid for itself in hauling to the dumpster and moving my shit from VA to DE.,
no not really. In my mind everybody in the US drives trucks and huge SUVs... can't be that everyone over there is hauling around stuff and towing other cars all the time.
people just love the idea of having the possibility to do so even though they probably never will.,
Gas trucks are going to be around awhile,
Anyone who knows a thing about EVs knows that towing was always going to be the catch on EV trucks.,
Not if you are towing a diesel generator. Get serious.,
RIVN calls,
So you can tow extra batteries with you,
You know nothing about trucks. Most people in Texas drive trucks. Most people in Texas don't do truck shit with trucks. It's comical. Big ass trucks just to drive around.,
[deleted],
No these trucks are for pretending like you “do stuff” and then having gay sex in the back seat,
Lol 80% of people who own trucks don’t fuckin tow shit,
lol weakass truck but this is gonna rocket their stock,
I own a truck to give the illusion I'm a blue collar hard worker.,
I ain’t getting in until they show that mother fucker driving up a hill.,
ITT: “Reeeeee! This electric pickup marketed toward people who go camping on the weekends and *don’t* use a truck for work can’t do what my 1 ton 3500 Dura-Cummin-Max can do.”

Uh, yeah, it’s not supposed to. It’s almost like trucks like this, the new Ford Maverick, etc have a different market than your use case and both are valid products. But go off I guess.,
This is more reason why I’m bull on Ford. I like Rivian but they don’t cater to truck people that use them for work. They are catering to upscale people that want to “camp outside” on the weekends. While there is a big market for that sure but why not have a truck that does the work and the play?,
Personally I think the rivian truck is great for off-roading, adventures, etc, but at the end of the day it’s not a truck. You can’t throw a load of gravel or dirt or manure in the back. You can’t tow long distance. And you can’t swap off the bed for something else. 

It’s a great jeep replacement though.,
Unpopular opinion, but unless you’re regularly towing or hauling, having a pickup truck makes you look like a douchebag.,
Same reason EVs aren't used in any racing except drag racing yet.  Lots of load drains the batteries heavily, and recharging them takes too long.,
F Bezos and F rivian trash,

Soooo CyberTruck wins????,
The thing I like most about this truck is its chill factor.  After seeing the Doug Murano off road video, nobody can question that this truck can rip shit up.  So you have a truck that is chill enough for everyday use, that can rip shit up when needed.

What else do you want?

PS

If Musk and company wanted CyberTruck to be the defacto electric truck, they should have stopped jerking off to Texas, and actually built one.,
The f150 lightning has this problem too.

All electric cars have this problem.

Hell, ICE trucks run into this problem towing things too. The problem is that charging an EV takes 45 minutes vs a 5-minute fill up at Shell.,
118 mile range while towing another car on a flatbed trailer is not bad. If you need more range while towing that much load, then it's not a good choice, but that's a very small minority even of pickup truck owners.,
Same thing happens to my gas truck when I tow.,
The funniest part is Chamath just said he does not think Rivian is overvalued. Like what the actual fuck. Any rational person who say yes it is.,
Dog shit,
Show me an el camino style electric truck that can raise up for off-roading and I'm in.,
The fuel economy in my ICE F-150 drops in half when I’m towing so I don’t see it as that big of an issue.,
And why is that a surprise?,
I own a 6 cylinder f150 that I have never used for towing, but I have beat that bed to shit moving things around and various hobbies I have. I'd probably take one of these if I wasn't afraid to scratch it.,
They need to abandon this stupid truck and focus on making long range delivery vehicles and commercial trucks for logistics companies like amazon. The fact that they have amazon as a major investor should be a golden ticket to owning the commercial trucking/logistics market. 


This whole consumer truck thing is stupid and a waste of time. Leave that shit to Ford and other companies that have been making trucks for decades.,
Highway towing is not the only use case. Good for towing things around farms - which is the use case my my rural family usually has for pickup trucks.,
The bed for moving larger sized objects would be more useful to me. When I had my trucks and SUVs with a towing package, I've towed 1 time.,
Rivian is the next delorean,
I mean my gas truck uses 40% more gas when towing half its max load, so 62% loss at max towing isn't to bad. Am I wrong?,
Same applies to a diesel pickup. Some can get 20 mpg empty. Towing, 10 mpg. I don’t see how this is a shocker.,
I haven't towed anything in four years owning my truck. I wanted a truck because I'm 6"5 and needed something easy to get in and out of.,
That's expected. A modern pickup will get ~20mpg highway normally but drop as low as 5-8mpg while towing a heavy load like a 5th wheel camper trailer or flat bed with a car on it as shown in the photo.,
Who cares![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Wait, are u telling me electric vehicles aren't a magic elixir!?!? Blasphemy!,
Ford f150s go from 24MPG to 10.9MPG while towing i think that's the average loss for mid sized trucks while towing. You have to get larger trucks the percentage is less but still not great.,
If you take a closer look at the R1T, it more closely resembles an electric Ridgeline (i.e. city truck) than something like the F150 lightning or cybertruck. The rivian was never built to be a tow rig.

For reference, a regular ICE truck will lose up to 35% mpg when towing.,
I am having trouble finding this information anywhere,  what are the towing range loss of a regular ice truck?,
That blows but from my thoughts, everyone and their mom buys a pickup eith four doors like they are fuckin minivans, they wont tow fuck all beside the fridge and stove, if they wanted to move shit they just rent stuff from uhaul, thats the way things seem from my perspective these days,
Towing is genuinely not the point of owning a truck. 

A lot of people who need to tow shit just buy a minivan.,
No one goes overlanding with a trailer. Rivian customers are the tricked-out Tacoma, jeep, and 4runner crowd. People with the annoying tent toppers etc.

No one looking to buy an electric truck is planning on towing a huge amount with it.

Diesel engines ain't going anywhere for this reason.,
A 2010 Honda Ridgeline is a much better truck

Maybe $12,000 with reasonable mileage,
What’s it like if they are towing a 30 foot battery / solar / windmill trailer? Or a fully charged rivian?,
Rivian..no production and the stock is still over 100...just dumb,
The last truck I had wasn't much better.

Round trip, from Minneapolis to Houston, the Raptor I had averaged 7.8 mpg towing an Evo IX on a steel trailer with a tire rack on the front of it.,
That sort of range hit while towing is pretty much unavoidable.  It takes X amount of energy to punch the truck through the air.  The trailer is going to increase that, probably by a lot.  


It's just a lot more noticeable with EV's because the cars are optimized to be so much more efficient than ICE vehicles.  Then you hook a big airbrake of a trailer to the back of it and the range goes to shit.  


With an ICE truck you'd just stop more often and try not to think about the fuel economy.  With an EV you're also stopping more often, but those stops are a hell of a lot longer and most DC fast charging installations aren't set up to pull-through, so you'd have to unhook the trailer and pull into a parking spot to plug in.  


This is gonna be a problem for the Rivian, it's gonna be a problem for the F-150 lightning, and it's gonna be a problem for the Cybertruck.,
Towing is not essential for all pickup users. I think I heard numbers from Ford a few months ago saying that 40% of pickup owners are what they call “never-nevers”, meaning they never tow and never go off-road. 

Having said that, this is one more data point that keeps me bearish on EVs for universal adoption. Towing obviously requires more energy but EVs are handicapped in relation to gas because it is way easier and faster to refuel a gas vehicle and that is exacerbated when you are losing > 50% of your range on something basic. Either batteries need to get a lot more efficient or a lot of capital needs to be deployed to develop a more robust super charging network. Til then they are just psychological luxuries.,
This isn't a Rivian problem. It's a... physics problem.,
Designing a truck that wouldnt loose 50%+ of it's range while towing would have required alot of engineering work to figure out an exoskeleton, aerodynamic shape, light, and energy dense batteries(like the Cyber truck) would be needed to actually make an EV truck work.....Rivian didnt have time for that.  Bezos is going to be steaming when his Amazon trucks cant make it 2 hours on the road.,
I have been looking to buy a truck - just so I can drive to and from work.

and be able to haul "stuff" from Big box store.

and be able to drive off the freeway onto feeder roads when freeways slows down to parking lot speeds.,
Well every petroleum powered vehicle loses a significant amount of range when towing. This is common sense. Did people think it wouldn't lose half or more of it's range towing? That's a given... Common sense.,
Towing increases battery usage. Crazy,
What would the equivalent detrimental effect on fuel economy be on a Unleaded or Diesel same-type vehicle?,
Honestly, that is impressive pulling 11000lbs.  We aren't talking about a single axle towing your lawn mower or a couch which can be pulled by a Subaru.  11000lbs is a serious load.  You can still pull a decent sized boat to the lake, 30+ ft. camper, etc.  You can pull dump trailers with a small skid steer, etc.

Now, I can't hook the snowmobile trailer up to it because of the range/isolation but outside of that...,
No, towing isn’t an essential part of owning a truck.  It is however pretty essential when the truck bed is only 4 feet long.,
The regen braking must be fun though,
Yeet,
Most trucks and SUVs never tow anything or go offroad...,
Stock will shoot up 62%,
No. It was, but isn’t anymore. Nowadays it’s just another human mover with a big trunk,
More than half of truck owners never tow shit.,
Most trucks never even see a dirt road, let alone tow something.,
well as the owner of a big truck I can say the point is to have said big truck.,
Towing causes an equivalent drop in range on gas powered vehicles.  My ecoboost F-150 would go from 16 mpg to 7 mpg.,
Definitely not *the* point, but certainly one of them.,
Lol DUH! Stupid electric owners,
this is true for gas powered trucks too. this is just physics. acting like it is a surprise is funny.,
As far as I know all electric cars have lower range when towing. But I am not sure what's normal loss percentage.,
I mean I’d be willing to bet good money that 50% or more of non-work trucks have never had anything hooked up to their hitch.,
So they towed 3,000 lbs over the towing capacity then were surprised the range loss that’s higher than advertised.

I’m not the biggest fan of the Rivian but running a test at 130% of the trials isn’t a very good comparison to go off of. 

With 75% of truck owners hauling 1 time a year or less this whole “point to owning a truck” doesn’t really on out for the actual American population buying them,
Fun fact: towing reducing the range of combustion vehicles too.,
The point of having a truck is endlessly hauling around sailboat fuel to prove how big your nuts are.,
Well I mean towing with my diesel pickup I see almost 50% range loss too,
It's called physics,
Where I am, trucks are a fashion / status statement more than 90% of the time, and are almost never used for anything resembling actual truck shit. If this is the case elsewhere (pretty sure it is), the lack of towing range won't really be a problem.,
That’s about right for gas powered too. Rivian ain’t special.,
Owned many trucks never towed anything so. . Nah,
This is to be expected with electric towing in general. I mean, it’s too be expected with anything. When you tow, you’re gonna use more fuel/energy. All based on weight, drag, wind, etc. 

That being said, electric vehicles have a long ways to go to be competitive with ICE vehicles. Yes, I know there is electric semis but let me be honest when I say, they suck and are far off from being comparable to an ICE equivalent.,
That's the case with all trucks though. My RAM trucks range with a full tank drops exponentially when towing. I think Ford trucks have it the worst though.,
Most people who own trucks actually dont tow. The purpose of a tow truck is to tow..,
I bought a truck to make my penis look bigger, sir!,
Wouldn't a GAS or DIESEL vehicle "lose" range as well? What's the point?,
so you're saying to sell my house and use money to buy all rivian stock?,
They should share tech with NKLA,
Duh. Imagine of it was cold too. EVs are the answer if you want a truck for truck reasons. Buy a diesel,
These people haven’t been to the south. We all have trucks down here for clout not purpose,
Duh. Maybe try towing a battery.,
doesnt matter…amazon has ordered thousands of vehicles,

I have 36 positions. 34 are red today. But I'll be back god dammit.,
The world is not going to end just because there is another variant. I play the long game. I will just keep buying as long as everything is on sale.,
When do I contract the "wealthy" variant?,
Latest: Latest strain has been around for weeks and did not originate in S. Africa. Nobody in hospitals from this one, no or mild symptoms, only detected in tests. Stocks back up (especially Tesla).,
“Covid variant”. Sure. Covid has been used as a cover for blatant market manipulation - and everything else - since this whole fiasco started.,
Nah the sell off is due to the potential changes in tax structure that will likely take effect next year.  The sell off will continue until the end of the year.,
More like Goldman Sachs and friends need an excuse to take profits on our greedy hands,
It's that buy low sell lower time of the year,

mfw i bought air lines and cruise lines in march thinking summer will be back to normal. getting fucking shit on atm and still holding,
Happy Red Tuesday!,
You mean “media hype” not covid variant. They are overhyping the shit out of this, and people react to fear pitifully.,
Exempt from this meme is Wish,
Buy spot calls. NFA,
Oh no, stonks haven't seen prices this low since...three weeks ago! Stonks only go up, fluctuations of a few percent is just noise.,
WOW,
That's me!,
Yes they do we have nothing to worry. This is not going down for several more years 5+ at least. So buy on and let it keep moving higher..,
Is that a black swan in the background? :-),
It will go up, because you can’t come home without buying for xmas. Suckers!!!,
If CBS needs to call it a strain instead of a variant, it's probably not a real issue.,
Thoughts and Prayers,
💯,
Buy the last dip,
Why did you make a meme out of your moms?,
Basically the tradingview index chat. people constantly repeating stocks always go up.,
Would be funny if the bear just said down lol,
its funnier knowing that variant has been around for months.,
OTM weeklies only,
This is an excellent meme,
thats a great steelhead,
IDK what you're on about, my stocks still going up,
The bear needs to be changed to Fed taper.  Far more significant,
Until they don't,
$ocgn anyone?,
How about $AMC?,
This is exactly how some of them think 
Thinking it all a safe haven and shit is all sweet 
Then us bears come in do our 🌈🌈🌈🌈 dance 
And claw their asses 🐻🐻🐻🐻,

Looks like a break out 😂😂,
Y'all be the line drawenist motherfuckers around here.,
Two three point trend lines goddamn this is gonna moon 🌚,
I like how straight your lines are.,
SPY 500 EOY,
What is this the roaring twenties? Why are those lines black and white? This can't be right if there is no colors in those lines. Real technical analysis has like red and green and shit.,
Lines not straight on bumpy ride.,
I took the vaccine, does this mean I am short this index?,
Costco toilet paper mooning,
death cross?,
I’m seeing a heavy support and lowering resistance there bud. Might be a dump on the cases incoming.,
should I buy Pfizer stock?  I'm new to all this.,
https://i.gyazo.com/c178a07de622297dc482d1695ea8badb.png

I'd do it more like this. You could call that a pennant, sym triangle, whatever, but I think it'll act like an H&S and fail on the res from the left.,
Confirmed breakout EOY,
Classic head and shoulders fake out into a flag breakout. Works 60% of the time every time,
Classic cock and balls formation,
You’re in a channel that’s running out of buyers, not a wedge here.,
Why aren't weed stocks considered "stay at home" stocks? It puts the "chill" in Netflix and chill. lol,
Don't you people know that's how virus work? They mutate. Quit living in fear.,
There is a breakout coming! I’m buying calls!,
Looks like a flag...? Why isn't the bottom line horizontal?,
Need some price action going on,
looks like a wedge gonna break out :)),
This is hilarious lol!,
Didn’t know Michael J Fox was on here.,
Looks like it's about to breakout.,
So what's the play? I just see a graph of cases,
Buy @ 400k,
Very droll.,
i'm usually on board with all the hype for most stuff  but i'm tired of this i'm not getting this new omicron virus i'll wait til next year,
Triple bottom!,
Ahahaha and we thought June 2020 was a “wave” ahahahahahahaha,
I can see SPACS parachuting in to south africa to aquire it......if your gonna go all in you must hurry the boat loading up your money is about to sail to caymen,
Buy it's trading at 600k per share. That's not sustainable.,
fuck me. thats a continuation pattern.,
Mooning soon? Covid shorts about to get squeezed,
I will join you by YOLOing all of my 200 shekels into $COVID,
Omicron seems to be a good spreader but so far the cases seem to be mostly mild. No deaths. Omicron doesn't seem to be dangerous variant of covid.
So... Yeah. Might have to overthink your your position.,

Besides green is good, I have no idea what any of this means.,

This is america,
Happy to be a part of “Community”,
i was rich once, for about a day and a half,
Too real 
I’m glad I’m not alone 🥺,
It's okay, I've lost about 30k in the past 4 years,
6 bull runs and a dip,
Buy the dip.,
#DarkestTimeline,
Only down 27% today sorry but that's not a true retard,
I lost a good 5% across my portfolio today. Took only an hour ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),

So it was you who made de stocks go down early today. Cool to know I'm not the only one with this superpower.,
Bought 375 today…,
I hope most of those are going to Computershare.,
show gains,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Confuckyoulations,
🚀🚀🚀Godspeed ape, to the moon!🚀🚀🚀,
I fucking love how angry and salty GME posts like this make the comments. "I miss old WSB" says the 1 year old account that has only posted about WISH 😂,
Down $10,000 in the two hours since posted,
Finally a GME post!! ☺️ 
-----------❤️❤️❤️-----------,
Diamond balls!!!,
I think at this point you could just buy a gamestop store.,
You're a retard,
Lol 2020 called and wants back its xmas stocks,
YOU FILTHY BASTARD! Congrats.,
Is this a YOLO or a bag-holder's lament?,
I regret selling my game shares. Paper hands like a bit h,
Yeah boy you go!!,
*These bags are made for HODLin'*

*and that's just what apes do*

*one of these days these bags are gonna*

*make apes destitute*,
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
Enjoy the -10% today.,
Good now sell weekly OTM covered calls on them.,
Beast,
Drs half of em,
Let’s fucking go,
Congrats you can file for unemployment again,
The ape retards downvoting everything that doesn’t fit the narrative. 

So novel. 

This dude’s average price per share is $202. 

Fuck. He bought an over priced stock in bulk. 

That’s definitely hardcore retardation.,
Nice!,
Congrats!,
You’re a legend in my books! ❤️,
you're about a year late,
*Bogdanoff, finish him*,
Congratulations you’re retarded and eventually broke,
I wish all the Apes luck! But I'm stayin the fuck away.,
Why are you guys still buying this shit stock? Covered calls ?,
Anyone investing in GME now is just putting their money on fire,
So when's the "Mother of all short squeezes" happening lads? Any new dates to look forward to?,
I cannot believe people are still in on this, like it went from $4 to $400. It’s over, you missed the fun, go home! If you think it didn’t “squeeze” you sound like a qanon fuck denying reality.,
LoL GME is done bro you missed it by a year. You think it’s going to run again? 🤨,
But... but, why?,
If you aren’t selling 10 way OTM weekly calls every week then you’re actually dumb.,
Have fun holding that bag my friend.,
I'm buying the dip! Big push GME on the discount.... gonna moon bitches!,
Really still on this GME train? 🤦‍♀️ a year too late 😂,
Had those, too.
Were only 4k

Fml,
epic pro!,
I'm sorry you did this,
Today sucked. That is all.,
Is GME dead?,
GME $100 soon,
Is GME gonna go up again? I thought the 2020 surge was all there was?,
Those would have been a smart play this time last year. Not so much now buddy.,
F,
#why?,
wow. I didn't think anyone was still buying Game Stop...  Hope your average is low and you're out of short term gains range so you can sell it and get some of your money back. 

But then again, what do I know.,
You know you can buy games and funky pops cheaper on Amazon right ? Why would you buy this trash,
Why does it keep going down tho,
And that is why no one will remember your name, enjoy bankruptcy,
You are going to $WISH you sold,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) didn't GameStop go bankrupt years ago?,
Hit the showers champ. You did great ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Computershare is neat and adds to illiquidity. SHF can still pull shares out of ETFs (its expensive, but they do it). Why not bash them over the head with options? They're super exposed come 2022,
🦍🤜🤛🦍💎✋🚀🍦,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
To think if you bought 18 months ago your cost basis would only have been 4k,
I'll pray for you fool.,
Black hole,
Very risky.,
Sell now for 100% gains!,
you're a pretty cool guy,
Respects OP,
Is this the guy who wanted to own Gamestop?,

Lol. The sea of red.,
Just listening to Powell’s and Yellen’s dry voices talk money to me and imagining how hot their kid would be.,
When reading this thread take a shot every time you see a comment from OP thats says "Until people cut back on their wants and economize on their needs".

Im fucking drunk.,
Oh, the RISK of inflation has increased?  
Silly me. I thought inflation had increased. I must be seeing something else.  
Can somebody please draw this with crayons?,
There’s no risk, that shit is here,
He’s the last person to realize this and is in charge of our economy?,
Just rip the bandaid off already. Immediately stop tapering and raise interest rates….let’s see what happens.,
Inflation is not transitory, it’s transitioning to higher highs 😂🤣😭,
The united States needs to use some of its defense budget and open a semiconductor factory in the states.,
Wait... So you're telling me if you print trillions of dollar and pump it into the economy, it causes inflation? Don't be silly. 🤡,
And to that solution is to delay tapering, keep interest rates low indefinitely, and increase QE. I'm surprised rest of the world still values the US stock market and Dollar,
I love that the entirety of wsb worshipped jpow and his money printer and amazing ability to pretend inflation was transitory for years, and the moment he finally publicly mentions inflation might be an issue we’re all like FUCK THIS DUMB IDIOT.,
But everyone was saying that inflation is good, it moves the economy and make people spend more.,
recession is priced in so bullish obviously, spy calls 0dte yolo for tomorrow,
So he's saying higher revenues

 Ergo 
stonks go up.,
I'm sorry but how the fuck are you leading the fed if you are JUST coming to that realization. 

I mean he obviously is just a political wiz saying whats necessary to boost the economy and justify it. 

or hes dumb as rocks, which obviously isn't the case, just a wiz w words,
You can see exactly when he mentioned the word inflation… down to the minute. Market took a dive,
Bullish, people will jump into stocks to avoid inflation and businesses will have to raise prices which means bigger numbers on the sheets which means higher stonk price, all in on SPY until the end of the world, this bull run will never end, we all gonna be billionaires, leeeeets goooo!,
buy Calls or puts, quick.,
We are so fucked. Still gonna buy the dip tho lol,
Did he really say its time to retire 'transitory' for inflation? No shit sherlock, we have been saying that for months. What a fucking moron.,
Fucking Retard. It's called Hyper Inflation. And it started last year when you turned on the infinity printer. 🤡,

Run for the hills!,
Ya don't say....,
Shut your whore mouth Jerome. Cut on the money printer and bring me a joint,
#Let's LOCKDOWN forever. F this,
I’m Shocked 😏,
Inflation = good for stocks, bad for cash. Selling today would be a smol pp move.,
You don't say,
Rank Xerox employee of the decade.,
Is that a warning or a threat?,
JPOW>omicron in crashing the markets,
Shut up and bring out the printer.,
Ya don’t fucking say?,
Lol.
Brilliant statements like this almost make me miss the days of Greenspan.,
It's almost like swimming over to the ladder of the pool and telling someone in a deck chair, "hey bud, we might get a little wet.",
ITT: Arm-chair economists suggesting how they can run the economy better than Powell.

It is a supply-chain issue caused due to pandemic. If pandemic is transitory inflation would be as well. If pandemic prolongs, inflation prolongs as well.,
Well, just don't buy $GOLD as an investment hedge.  $Gold is my worst performing stock of the year.  Gold is a useless boomer asset similar to investing in boomer horse & buggy after the invention of the internal combustion engine.,
Priced in. Fuck off,
No kidding, the second BIden was elected i knew that, how long can we keep lying to ourselves, seriously?,
Gave every answer ..except, MONEY PRINTING, = Inflation. fuk 6th grade answers full of lies.,
BuY tHe DiP bRo,
I'm not at all surprised, considering half a year or so ago the government was all "don't worry we're sure its temporary due to the pandemic" yada yada yada.   Liars.,
Oh fuck you, you fucking fuck.
We knew since years. Thanks for finally admitting,
No shit that's what happens when you just print money to keep the criminals of the market afloat,
Classic.

Dude got another term and is ready to fuck you up.,
No way. Didn't see this coming, at all.,
lol who knew printing money would cause inflation.,
Gee thanks @sshole, tanked the market,
It’s almost like he was completely wrong and has no idea what he is actually doing,
What a dick,
So if the 70s is going to repeat itself, will weird hairscuts and clothing be coming into style soon?,
Risk of higher inflation. Not higher inflation. Really!!?? Brilliant!!,
And nobody seen it coming lol,
Pennsylvania $6.99 for a pack of bacon,
Who saw this coming…….thought this shit was transitory..whatever the fuck that’s supposed to mean. Lasting not forever I guess.,
Memba when it was transitory?  I memba.,
No shit Sherlock,
$BTC,
I plan to buy the shit out a red December.  By April it will be a great move.,
fuck this clown, everyone has been calling this since Q1 2021,
This is bad. Very sad. 

JPOW no longer has big dick energy. JPOW is now a tiny pp man trying to fuck my portfolio.

Puts on $JPOW. Calls on $PFE (Viagra sales to the moon),
Abolish the fed.  Bunch of academic quacks that have never held a real job.,
Not to worry. The rate of increase of risk of increase in inflation is actually decreasing,
This fucking guy,

A bag of spinach is $5.99 - fire these boomers,
[deleted],
Spy should be inflated to 600,
That boy is printing,
🌈🐻🌈,
Really?  I mean the signs weren't there six.months ago?  I mean pumping money in against supply side restrictions and we get inflation? No?  Couldn't have seen that one coming...,
How does he still have his job?!?,
inflation is the interest rate, sadly.😬,
So raise rates… oh wait, you can’t raise rates on a govt that’s $30 Trillion in debt running $3 trillion + annual budget deficits, in an economy with the highest levels of corporate debt in history, in a corporate environment that is 100% addicted to cheap credit to kick the can of perpetual unprofitability down the road, and with record levels of consumer debt and speculation.

So get ready for even more inflationary rape until the rest of the world rightfully drops the dollar and we are no longer able to sustain our artificially inflated standard of living with $90 billion monthly trade deficits and the armada of cargo ships sitting offshore to unload real goods in exchange for our rapidly declining dollars, turn back towards Asia. At that point strap on your stocking and hit the rouge because you’ll need to look pretty in order to earn that bag of possibly rancid flour and cooking oil to keep you alive for the next few days.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
Why would stocks go down if there is inflation. Shouldn't the opposite happen? If all prices go up wouldn't all the assets of The company and all of their prices of the products they sell go up?,
NO SHIT SHERLOCK,
Welcome to the party pal!,
These fucks are useless!,
Noooooooo shiiiiiiiiiiiitttt.

I've been saying this since he started hitting print non stop in March.

There is literally no incentive for him to stop printing. The idea that he thought it would just be transitory was so retarded.,
You know what I hear inflation hates?

Digital Printer Ink,
trickle down economy trickles down some truth.,

My mom is transitory but my dad said we don't like to talk about it,
I just buy sectors that can pass their inflated prices on to consumers. Easy,
I like how everyone knew it wasn't transitory and people act like J Powell not lying for once means anything besides a good dip to buy while the idiots sell.,
Powelled, right in the kisser!,
What did Jay Pow say and do today?,
Bears got destroyed by Tim Apple,
I had to delete and reinstall my trading app. Tomorrow is a new day,
Lol spy still up how much on the year ???,
[It’s transitory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q96tzp/thanks_j_pow_keep_them_printers_running/),
Suck my Powell,
Fucked hard,
but the printers still going brrrrrrrrrrrr,
Nancy Pelosi is very most now. Mmmmm.,

Al least you’ll have the right ticker when your account reads DoNUT.,
Nice bags.,
On Monday I publicly called dnut at sub 13 by friday.  Neato,
Enough of a DD for me.   Buying in.,
What do we seeing this going to?,
calls on $POLICE

Because they eat $DNUT,
They wanted 17, but probably would have taken 10.  Company has been in rough shape financially, would not touch with a 10 ft pole,
I saw that info since last week I have been buying calls and stocks like crazy, I think there are only 2 posiblities: 1. Insiders know something and we need to get in 2. Insiders are fkcng retardeds and want to burn their money. Anyways I accept both,
DNUT = deez nutz,

Bought these puts slightly after open, friend said Powell speaks and market tanks and said buy Puts,
Serious question: I don’t understand buying options. Where can I do some research for it?,
Futures say you’re fucked,
Up 25k ... I assume you're going to be letting your friends go to pound town on your wife?,
Clearly sometimes it’s good to be a sheep.  Lol, damn.,
Cease and Desist.
By this comment we are serving you with a cease and desist, Mr. Pelosi has asked that you stop referring to him as a friend.,
What's your Shepard having you play next lol.,
Timberrrrr!!! Hope you sold.,
I need your friends,
I’ve got an offer in for a LOT of SPY based solely on this post. I can’t lose.,

I’m right there with you, I’ve got 1000 shares and 100 $39 calls Dec17 and 100 $42 calls Dec31,
Thoughts on RIOT vs HUT? similar market caps but from what I've seen HUT has better fundamentals.,
Riot is good Mara is better at current prices,
2 strategies. 1. Go to the moon. 2. Go to mars.,
Explain to me, how does one get 50k? I'm reading this subreddit with all you fuckers investing into shit, but like how do you even have savings, or side money to invest? Im 28 years old and I work full time job @ 22$ an hour getting frustrated with inflation making my life harder month to month. please explain how to have money.  I really don't get it.,
Someone pitch me Riot,
Hell yeah! I’ve got 700 shares @ $32ish cost basis. I’m loving the free $ from covered calls. I also do cash secured puts when it dips hard too.,
Ticker   FORT.V,

Such diversity,
Man the dip keeps dipping,
Sell it and yolo to SPY 12/17 460C. You'll double it easily

Not financial advice,
-65%? I'm barely aroused.

Let me know once you've sold naked puts and turn that to -165%.,
WISH is the gift that keeps on giving, like herpes,
Sell covered calls to other WSB smooth brains,
At least you are in a solid company with a solid dividend, just ride it out!,
Why don’t you sell and re buy at $2?,
At least we still get to see posts about WISH.

Cause all the fucking dentists have quit their jobs apparently.,
You can still buy 18k items on wish with free shipping, you probably won't get them till next xmas though. 🎄

Merry Xmas!!!  🎅,
God, I love wish porn.,
It’s like you hate money or something.,
I’ve seen worse averages tbh. I would hold.,
At least all your eggs aren’t in 1 basket.,
Is the other .12% of your port in CLOV?,
losing 65% of your whole portfolio in a single stock is impressive,
I think someone could short $Wish at this price and still make good profit.,
Imagine still holding WISH positions,
Hope you bought your Xmas gifts in October on wish and you might at least get some sort of consolation prize for getting drilled in the ass with the share price.,
Congrats....still plenty of room to run to zero. Not sure how much time you have though.,
You mean to tell me there’s all these great stocks and you chose WISH. Damn bruh - good luck though,
Hold’em bags. Our day is coming.,
shares… 🌈,
Thank you Clarice.   Thank you,
If you buy 10,000 shares you can lower your average and sell more calls.,
Keep the change,
Looks like you bought your shares all at once,
I am happy to say that I was your 420th upvote. Here is a free award for your efforts.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
I Wish you a Merry Christmas!,
So glad I got out at 8

Thank god,
I really don’t get why all these people yolo into wish at first place. Bad fundamental, ok we don’t care much about that! Squeeze? Da fk, it’s SI is lower than 10% of the float when it was around 9-10$. 🥲,
Tough week since Friday.,
are you at least selling covered calls? you are missing out a lot if you aren't

it'll never go back up so just sell atm,
Bro why?,
I love when the degenerates on here throw tens of thousands of dollars at shit companies expecting to get rich and post their massive losses

Thanks for the porn,
What is your thesis on this trash company?,
Wish is a risky gamble but I think it'll turn around in a month or two,
Such diversify portfolio. Such wow.,
In b4 wish is the next GME since everyone thinks the business should fail. Someone call Ryan Cohen.,
Ouch i feel you same here,
Hold them bag your day will come.,
holding along with you with 2000 shares. Hopefully we can see the new management team gets things right or they get bought out by some whale.,
If it drops to $1 I'll buy 100,
New Year's Resolution: work at wendys.,
Good thing I sold at around $5...,
You should have bought $EBAY if online retailers are your thing.  You might be better off selling your remaining $WISH position and reinvesting into $EBAY today actually.,
It's not going to turn around.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Ho. Ho. Ho.,
And a happy New Year,
This looks like a good entry point, try to average down,
FOMO is a bitch. WISH i died,
Red is a Christmas colour, your line graph is pointing down, Father Christmas also wears red and goes down the chimney. Expert level DD,
Didn’t even have to look at the ticker to know it was wish,
Your wife’s boyfriend wants to have a word with you behind the wendys.,
Props for posting it.  Quite the trail of bodies leading to WISH here,
My condolences, I'm sorry for your loss.,
I want to follow the progress of this more than watching my own son grow up.,
If you want more laughs just look at the webull comments through out the day. I crack up so much.,
Last year, many WSB members were holding PLTR Dec calls.  All of them lost their money.  This year on Dec 2021. It would be #Wish.,
This is crazy, I had 15k in PYR the past few weeks, lost like 2k. When it hit 3.98 I fucking dumped. yes its 4.17 now but god that loss gives you such a .. whatever the opposite of a boner is.,
I think you shouldn't be  $WISHing  anything :D,
Guh,
YIKES!!!
$WISH you a merry Christmas.,
is this the time to buy the dip?,
settle down - we still got 3 weeks left until Christmas,
Those extra 7 shares tho,
The dip that keeps on dippin’,

Shut up and tell me what to buy,
RemindMe! 40 years,
Tell me you’re balls deep in $TSLA calls without telling me you’re balls deep in $TSLA calls.,
Elons;gate,
Part 2: Tesla becomes galactic mega corp.

Part 3: Tesla helps Mars declare independence from Earth overlord.,
If he was from the future he would have kept the McLaren F1 he wrecked the first day he had it, and have it fixed even though it was "totalled". Its impossible to total one in reality as they are worth millions, but he had no insurance and couldn't drive it (obviously retarded).,
Mark my words, Tesla won’t be remembered as an electric car company. They’ll be remembered as an energy company that happens to make cars. In 10 years time I imagine the majority of their worth will come from solar and batteries.,
That's why cybertruck and semi release date got postponed like 4 times?,
By the time time travel is possible, the world will be a big ball of fire.,
See you in 40 years then mate,
Was it luck? Angels? Matthew McConaughey pushing books in a black hole trying to save the planet? Or Time Travel? 

We're in a time when concepts like this no longer seem so farfetched and perhaps you sir are the one whom is early.,
!remindme 39 years 364 days,
What strain you smoking bro? I’m trying to pick some up for sure.,
Soulja boy did it 1st,
Posts like these are what give me faith in my long term TSLA puts,
What about his company wide email saying space x has the possibility of going bankrupt if they can't fix their rocket manufacturing for the Starship. Hw called all hands on deck over Thanksgiving to try and fix it.,
Tesla's not a time travel company, the CEO is just autistic. Any of you who have taken hardcore math know that if you're doing steady-state analysis, the math is super easy, and if you're doing transient analysis, the math is disgusting. If you have autism, there are dimensions of analysis, like emotions, that you are not moving in the same way as your peers, which means that if you can somehow get past the fact that you can't understand the people around you enough to formulae it, you can do the steady-state calculation on forecasting other people's emotions, since your emotions can be easily pulled out of your analysis, leaving just their emotions. A lot of big high level problems come out of humans just being emotional AF, and Daddy Elon can just gut check a forecast of the next 10 years of non-autistic people's emotions in aggregate, and then call on that knowledge to make big decisions.,
As of now they are still just a meme luxury car company. With lots and lots of similar competors and startups,
This guy wants to suck Musk's dick as bad as Crammer wants to suck off Jensen Huang,
Nah.  But he is immortal.

Think about it: if you had Elon money, what would you try to do first?  Go to space, or gain immortality?

That said, once you had gained immortality, wouldn’t you want to make sure you had a way off of this planet before you let other people know the secret?,
No he’s from a rich family who profited off a diamond mine during Apartheid,
imagine being so insanely retarded that you think time travel is possible.,
Thankfully they've also managed to avoid profits.,
RemindMe! 40 years,
Can you go to the past from the future?,
RemindMe! Yesterday,
Lol. Love drunken shitposts!! This will be fun to watch out for,
Elon, do you get back with Grimes in the future?,
What about the Aliens 👽🛸,
This is bullshit, nowhere did you mention an ibm 5100. How else are they gonna hack into CERN.,
!remindme 30 years,
It's cuz electric motors are simply far superior to gas motors. The battery is the hard part and they have engineered the shit out of it.

Lithium and cobalt mining and recycling will be next.,
RemindMe! 40 years,
Ok bag holder,
RemindMe! 5 years,
We also all live in a simulation. I was tripping on shrooms and had a chat with Elon about this,
RemindMe! 40 years!,
This is why I will continue to be all in on TSLA 

Positions: June 2023 $1000C’s, $1500C’s and a $2100C,
Tesla will be the 1st 10 trillion company in few years,
Consistently early?   They have missed a lot of targets.,
Using your brain and actually following up is a time machine. 

I can't do it.,
The eventual bubble burst and sequential bankruptcies are going to make this post real funny.,
I heard that if you go back in time and plow your grandma, it means you're altering the timeline and people will think you're kinda nasty.

Is that true?,
Still the service Center sold me 4 left side winter tires. How can you be from the Future with employees that stupid?,
If no entity owns mars cant elon just land there, plant a flag and say its his? canadian style,

OP's entry for today's retarded "if the crash happens tomorrow I'm next decade's new Michael bury" post ... Is accepted.,
Fed doesn’t care what Elon thinks. Only people on this sub pay that autist any real attention 

Market crash will happen at some point either way. Predicting and profiting on it realistically is beyond a gamble,
Can't wait to see the loss porn 🌈🐻,
The fed has not began to tighten, they have only committed to purchase less and print less.  That is not tightening.  Let's see if they can make it to zero, never mind selling back what they bought.,
Inversing arkk deserves a thread of its own.,
As of now since he posted yeatwrdsy he's in profit. Hey author, I support your bear balls. Can you tell us how you going to trade like time frame wise? Thanks for informative post.,
Bet u buying SPY puts when it hits -2% 😂,
Well, we can be sure whatever happens the rich will make sure their investments can outpace inflation.  The wtfhappenedin1971 stuff paints that picture pretty clearly.,
Liquidity problem? There is a record number, trillions of dollars, sitting around doing nothing except waiting to buy the dip.,
Are you Mohamed El-Erian ?,
OP post history 🌈 🐻 gospel,
So SPY $600C, got it.,
Fuk. I love this 🌈 🐻 💩 . Great info.,
I got that cyberwhistle though,
How did you go from pumping weed stocks and SPCE with emojis to this level of articulation? Would appreciate your source :),
Do the opposite of op,
I'm almost certain there's going to be a liquidity crisis.,
Increasing interest rates would be one solution, but that would probably crash the housing market.,
The fed knows damn well if they raise rates they’ll crash the market.,
I thought this was a shit post but homie really believes this,
Elon Musk is not Jesus or Socrates (or even Tesla),
J Powell don’t know shit. He’s literally been wrong on everything.,
Did you just justify quantitative easing?  We are not your people.,
No tightening is ever going to fix it, the system is too far gone,
Lool.....good luck to the fed if they even try raising rates, dude doesn't understand how much cash is out there waiting...,

TAKE A FUCKING BREAK. No revenge trading. A real break. Clear your head. I’ve been there,
*lost $30k this year*

*professional trader shit*

we have a ton of experts who can help you, right this way sir,

>Since losing all my money,  I've become very emotional

I dont know shit about dick but I can tell ya this ain't the way bub. Gotta check that feelings stuff at the door.,
I'm an options trader and SPY is one of the tickers I trade everyday, the others are a few large caps.

Your problems are not with SPY, your problems are with your abilities as a trader.

It took me a long time and a lot of work to come up with my current strategy, and I'll share that with you. However I want to be clear that the reason traders are profitable are not because of the technical analysis or strategy they implement. Sure, that is part of it, but it's not the reason.

Consistently profitable trading is about discipline and losing well. It's not about winning; winning takes care of itself and is very easy. At this stage, you do not need to be prematurely optimizing your winnings (letting runners run). Instead, you have to learn how to lose, and you have to learn how to be disciplined.

Learning how to lose is very difficult, because we're not wired to lose consistently but it's part of the job as a winning trader.

So here's a few tips.

1. You **MUST MUST MUST** practice and respect bankroll management. With where you are right now, do not risk more than 5% of your roll on a trade. This means if your roll is $10,000 and a SPY contract is $250 then you can only buy 2. As you grind your roll up, you're going to risk even less. If you have a $100,000 roll, you're going to risk 2.5% per trade. This may seem boring and conservative to you, but it's going to prevent you from becoming emotional in a trade, and that is **REALLY IMPORTANT.** Talk to any winning trader and bankroll management will be critical.
2. Find someone who trades daily as you do; talk each day; review trades. Be brutally honest with yourself and with the other individual(s). I can't tell you how valuable it is to have this.
3. Be prepared to NOT be profitable for a few years, and I am serious. Give yourself the freedom to lose and remind yourself that these first few years are about developing the mental discipline and patience necessary. It's cliché to say this, but do not play with money you cannot afford to lose because you WILL lose as you develop yourself. Everyone loses in this stage, so don't beat yourself up. Keep your head down and focused on the goal of consistency. That being said, to develop that discipline and emotional maturity you do need to be playing with real money; but respect rule #1

So, a bit about my strategy.

1. I trade only a few tickers (large cap, and SPY is one of them). I do this to minimize the risk of low liquidity. I am no where near trading the size where that would even be close to an issue, but I never wanted to worry about getting in/out quickly.
2. I trade market price using Interactive Brokers (They fill extremely quick). As mentioned, I trade options, and I always buy close to ITM with 1 week exp. in general. I know it's tempting to buy 0 day and get those insane returns (and losses), and that is cool.. if you want to get some sweet karma on WSB. But that isn't going to cut it if you want to be consistently profitable.
3. I trade using the 1 minute chart and I use support and resistance for 90% of my trades with the other 10% being trend reversal plays when they seem valid. You do not need pivot points, bollinger bands, macd, or even RSI. More specifically I tend to lean towards reversals versus trend following. So if I have a resistance level charted and I see the price moving towards it, I will get some puts. And the opposite, if I see a price falling to resistance I will get calls. I am typically not in a trade longer than 30 minutes. By that time I have either taken profits or taken a loss.
4. Expanding on #3 you are probably wondering how I decide to take profits or a loss. Typically I give myself some room, on SPY that is around 0.75 cents to be wrong. So to paint this picture more clearly, let's say SPY is trading at $450 and I have a resistance line at $451, SPY is climbing up to that and as it gets close I will buy puts. If it does not reject at resistance, I will give myself some room before I close out at a loss, and in this scenario that would be SPY hitting 451.75. I come up with this range based on the ATR of the ticker primarily, but also how I feel price is moving that day or recently. For profit taking, it's more of a feel and there isn't anything specific I rely on. Often it will be if the price is about to hit another resistance level.
5. I only trade the first few hours of the day, and often only the first hour. This is when the market is most volatile and offers it's biggest moves. I know of people who also trade the last hour for the same reason, but I don't. My whole strategy is based on being able to trade in the AM and have my freedom during the day.
6. I want to reemphasize that you do not need to waste time on indicators. If a gun is pressed against your head and you have to use one, RSI is the only one I could recommend. But price action is what it's all about.

If you do not already listen to it, chat with traders is a fantastic podcast. Here's a few of my favorite episodes which I am certain you will learn some valuable insight from:

[Adam Grimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz_l1OBJRK4)  
[James King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwnOdX2gGQ)  
[Jared Tendler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8TKLEMJwpY) (I worked with Jared personally on my mental game when I played poker, he is fantastic)  
[Futures Trader 71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woT6d7xUtOs)

Hope this was helpful; it's a long journey and there is no need to rush. Protect that bankroll. Be disciplined, and accept the monotony of the first few years. You're closer than you think.

DM's open - thanks for coming to my TED talk.,
Best advice I can give you? Touch grass, take a break. You’re chasing your losses.,
Just do the opposite of whatever you think you should do, then bank it.,
Losing money "professionally", classic.,
Check out r/optionsmillionaire, the guy on there Is legit and actually teaches you how to trade exclusively options on SPY/SPX based on volume, support and resistance,
Damn dude, you could have made $30k-$40k joining theta Gang by doing credit spread,
From the looks of it you should inverse yourself....If it's green hold it forever if it's red sell it....,
Rule 1.  Position sizing and risk management.,
Your problem is that you're NOT ANGRY ENOUGH. The market truly cares about your feelings and your anger will make it all better,
Change some views first, charts are bs for spy. Go learn how to read option chain, pivot points for BTD, it could get u places.,
Just take a break. Never do revenge trading.,
You only need one 1,900% gain to break even,
I lost my girl,money, and myself. I have one trade left that determines my fate,
It sounds like you really want to learn but you as well want to chase, I’ve been there and I’m sure everyone has too. I’m taking a break after being down my self. I’m just holding on to my shares no options at all. Sometimes doing nothing sitting back to recollect yourself is needed. I’m taking 2 months maybe 3 off of options. I plan to learn the options and the Greeks the best I can until I’m ready. Save your money don’t chase anymore. Come back next time with a solid game plan good luck to you don’t be stupid.,
How the fuck does no one ask some details about holding his "lovers to zero"?,
I've only profited off SPY when trading 30min-1hr after open, still in bed, on my phone, and on 0-1DTE FDs. Just watch futures and YOLO options in the morning. If you print bigly, wake up. If you shit the bed, just go back to sleep and pretend it was all a dream.,
If coming to WSB is your idea of investment or financial "research" the only answer you need is *you shouldn't be handling your own money.*,
Trade other stocks. You know how many pro traders trade /ES? You have to find an edge and trading the product that has the smartest people in the world trading it is not it.,
😳😬,
Flip a coin, heads for calls and tails for puts on weeklies.,
stop day trading dumbass

buy calls in big tech, Microsoft or Google after a nice dip like yesterday, and sell after a nice run up

then wait it buy puts after a huge number of consecutive green days

then get back to calls

this will require around 2 to three trades per month

once you've made it to 100k, take 10k and lose it again using your day trading techniques, but use the other 90k to keep growing

DON'T fucking buy options that expire les than 3 months,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Oof,
Just buy and hodl, why day trade? You must see it’s not working my guy.,
Try stocks not options until you grow up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Don’t trade options.  Everyone thinks they are a get rich quick trade.,
“I lost $30k this year doing *professional trader* shit”.

Well okay then, pro.,
Everytime you want to buy calls buy puts. Everytime you want to buy puts buy calls. Ez fix. But forreal you may need to get off spy. Picture it like playing basketball and you just need to see one go in,
Mate if you lost 30k and are left with 1.7k, maybe you should consider not doing retarded plays like spy calls and puts
Options trading only if you'd bet your left nut that things are gonna go your way,
Was gonna say you can’t call it “professional” if you’re negative but I guess this is finally my chance to be a pro at something,
Stop trading short term and buy for the long term. Stop trying to get rich overnight.

&#x200B;

Sorry. You asked.,
U r at the right place!,
Just do exactly the opposite of what you’re doing. You would have 60k more than you do now.,
Yes. Do it.,
You can make just as much as you lose, there's no winning strategy that doesn't come with a huge risk.,
Do the opposite,
Just buy calls it goes up,
tax deductible,
You've come to the right place. we're all \[self proclaimed\] professionals here.  


All of us \[monkeys\] here mostly yolo for fun and for clout. If you're getting upset over your losses, it might be time to slow it down and think things over. Your 1.7k is one FD away from getting back to 30k, but $0 worth of FDs will never make it back there.,
Depends on the market conditions - some days you can swing spy calls.  The past wk day trading worked well - just go long/short based on the range. 

Just look at volume profile, set the support resistance.,
Gotta have the bad days to appreciate the good days. Live and learn. The most crucial mistakes you make are the ones that are burned into your brain. 

Write your losers and winners into a notepad or book, analyze the trends and charts, and think about what happened. I panic really bad but when I start writing everything on paper and come out with at least 3 strategies for if it goes up down or sideways, you’ll know what to do. 

Take a break though for a week or two, clear your head and start it up again. Godspeed, retard,
Can I pay you money to tell me what trades you’ve just executed so I can do the opposite?

Seems like you trade based on emotion when you should be doing the inverse..,
Buy and HODL. Seriously. Trading may not be for you. I would also look at how many fees you've eaten this year and it may surprise you. I would describe 0-3 dte options as impossibly retarded personally. IV crush  & theta.

Having emotions involved is a bad idea best way to lose money is to trade on emotions. Maybe start with an entry and exit plan. Stop losses, profit targets, etc if you are not going to give  this up.  Finally, that 28k is gone don't reduce it to zero trying to "get back to even",
Whatever you're currently doing, just do the opposite,
If it was easy to make money off SPY daily or weekly options, lots of people would be doing it.

Lots of people do it.

It is not easy.

Lots of people lose money doing it.

>!You should stop doing it.!<,
Yes I’m an expert at spy contracts here’s one tip DONT,
Use 5min paired with 15, and 65 min and use indicators with support and resistance levels. Look at gamma data. Sounds like you mine as well go the casino and put all your money on red.,
The plays you are doing most likely lose also if you would invert them and do opposite. Huge % losses across options spreads, sort of like betting on either team in sports betting, eventually both sides lose, or like betting roulette red or black, both lose over time. The winners there as here is the house, the market makers making bank on that bid/ask spread. The only way to win is to not play.,
You are bad at this please stop.,
I tried to trade SPY and ES Futures for many years and couldnt do it. Gave up after 30-40k in losses, realized that equity markets basically just go up over long periods of time and its easier to buy and hold with maybe some occasional hedging in between. Also I never met anyone who day trades consistently and makes a living at it, aside one guy who used to work on the CME floor. I think day trading mostly benefits brokers. Maybe there are some talented people out there who have been day trading successfully for decades, but they are few and far between. The people who figured out day trading keep their strategies close to the vest in order to maintain an edge.,
Spy FD’s and $ROPE is the way. Ive lost 30k so you know my advice will make you rich,
If you ever feel like your back is against the wall money wise in this game. Take your money and run, recoup, go to work, them come back later if you want. Walk away with the 1700 and chill for awhile,
Pro advice: do exactly the opposite of what you’ve been doing,
I think SPY is all about the overall structure... what is VIXX doing, what is IWM doing, what's the economic data look like and what are the forecasts. What are the top individual stocks within it doing and their charts.

It's no different than with individual stocks. You may think you're only there trading on an intraday timeframe, but if you're trading at a moment where things will be very sensitive (say  GDP, labor, inflation, corporate earnings come out) and all this hedging activity is going on as things get repriced - meaning, during these times you're there thinking you're making plays off a chart, when they're actually expressive of bets based on macro things.

Too many traders don't realize how limited the chart is and they trade a stock thinking they're only going to hold for a day or two. It's still too long when fundamentals are at play and more dominant than the technicals. Without some kind of bigger picture opinion on things, you might as well be clicking at random.,

Lol stop trading options,
Pump all 1700 into 2 month SNDL calls at 1.15 (This is not financial advice.),
0dte to 3 days? You’re an actual monke,
Same, down 65k past two years. Professional trader shit as well.,
I was trading spy daily as well, it's hard and full of traps, nothing to rely on it, I just do it for fun these days, change your strategy
But if you insist I can give you some rips 
1: never play 0DT , do it with small amount ro satisfy  your gambling needs 
2: lower your risk after 3pm , those hours are crazy and they follow no rules 
3: be ready to reverse your position everytime  3min RSI chart touches 30 or 70 , wait for divergence in 3min chart and reverse it 
4: I found days with higher vix more predictable than lower vix 
Goodluck,
Don’t listen to these idiots and their advice. Please send proof of loss porn- you’re doing great!,
Wash sales are a bitch. Better to daytrade in an IRA or HSA.

Its easy to get your earnings wiped out by taxes if you overtrade and dont account for wash sales rules. It makes it so your wins get taxed but losses cannot be deducted.

It is possible with wash sales to LOSE money in your taxable account AND owe taxes at the end of the year.

Good luck,
That sounds neat and all but maybe find a useful hobby or good book,
Yolo the 1k7 remaining on SPY puts,
buy shares and hold. play options if you can lose,
Stop trading now. Setting yourself up for failure more so. If you’re over working by charting & examining everything you’re receiving diminished returns because you’re cooked brother. Walk away for a week or two,
Usually I close my eyes😌, buy calls 💵, pray to jpow 🙏,
Spy is kinda ranging these few weeks with some sudden dips.

0dte is really risky and choppy days are the best way to cut you out. The chances of it regaining in value are rly low and there are days to trade it and there are times to stay the hell out of it esp when the fed / jpow are speaking.

Sometimes its better to pick individual tickers that move well for the day and stick with it.,
I only trade covered indexes
0dte is a gamble as it might go either direction.

Buy long term spy and sell 30dte otm calls on it; you get income from the premium plus you keep the index and benefit also if it moves sideways.,
You really do need to be putting your stops on immediately. That stop should be the maximum amount you're willing to lose that day without being upset. If that amount is zero, then accept your loss and find a more sustainable approach to trading than 0-3DTE SPY options, which - with the exception if selling naked calls - are basically the riskiest form of trading possible.,
You gotta have structure.  You gotta have a Take Profit and a Stop Loss.  You gotta take your “L’s” when they come.,
Inverse yourself,
Fuck SPY! My first trade was 1 - $.15 option that went to $4.06. I was like fuck ya!!! Played a bunch of options and went up 10k only to loose 16k the next month. Almost got margin called yesterday.,
Sell OTM credit spreads or something, shit,
Learn to play and not play at will
 Try avoiding stocks for 1 month and see if you can’t resist then your a gambler

Gambler loose  and day trader hoes,
If your asking advice on WSB, you’ve already failed,
You suck at trading. Stop playing with options.,
If you want to be successful start trading spy options that have a .8 or higher delta ITM. Quit trying to get massive returns. a good 450 call today will cost you 12 dollars and might end at 15 dollars or 9 dollars. risk is less especially since you sound like a professional at throwing away your money.,
#1. You have to manage your risk.  Every trade can’t be a yolo. 1700 bucks means you can buy a couple calls.  I’d focus on long straddles for now.  Only viaotile  days. You should not trade more then 2/3 strikes out of the money in either directions calls/puts. Puts are usually better at opening and calls at closing.  Rarely hold them over night. Start paper trading. Most importantly set limits with your buys.  In other words when you place your trade set your exit limit. And exit profit.  Greed 25% is and will be your down fall,
Stop trading, you suck at it. Start investing,
You lost 95% of your money trying to day trade and haven’t realized it doesn’t work? You can’t just look at voodoo charts and make money? Might as well burn the rest of your money now,
How often were you short SPY? Were over half your trades short SPY?,
Just buy spy shares and hold. This bitch Only goes up over time. You’re losing money because you’re not looking at the bigger picture. Just buy   A share whenever you can afford to and watch it grow. Your options plays might be fun, but they obviously aren’t working rn.,
You guys he came here for advice... so here it is put it all in dog money.,

Doing yourself a huge, huge, huge disservice by not looking at your hourlys.

(If the mods delete this comment again I’m not going to bother again).,
This makes me sick to think about. I get putting it all on a short term bet but slowly losing that amount of money over a long period of time and thinking it will turn around is just sad, you need to reassess your whole plan,
Stop day trading. It's obviously not working out for you. Go for longer expiration dates.,
$SPY calls as long out as you can afford,
Can anyone tell me what SPY is? I hear it a lot but I dont know which company it is?,
Just put your money in a metal bin and set it on fire.,
You need to let your lovers go and if they come back to you it's true loss,
Lot of negative nancy’s around here 😤😤😤,
Lmao “professional trader shit,” stfu you wannabe. Perhaps losing 30k means you should idk, not pretend to be something you’re not. Technical analysis is bullshit and doesn’t work just apply at wendys,

Join the discord,
After going through this thread I just wanted to peak at some of your sentences again to confirm how I feel.

Fuck, man. You can’t LOSE on the SPY. Fuck.in’ guy, man..,
This market is simple RISK=REWARD just don't be greedy.![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
learn how to use MACD and Rsi I made my own strategy involving them (4 hour) 

when the bullish MACD line crosses buy either sell when the RSI is very strong and you are happy or sell when the MACD crosses again......

normally ill buy a call when the bullish MACD line crosses and then sell when it crosses back over I then put it and wait for it to cross back over again then buy a call I keep repeating this and it results in lots of profit you just need to learn MACD

this works 80% of the time the other 20% is me getting greedy or getting stuck in the position,
How the fuck do you lose money on the SPY? Have you figured out the companies that prop it up as of late? Have you read the recent news regarding these companies? Do you read? Do you get your reading ideas from wsb? You incrementally lost 30k and you’ve been on this sub for 3y? Wtf? I day trade SPY working construction and I don’t lose unless I have to be off my phone. Wtf? Laaaaaaaaaaaame!,

STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!,
#penises down,
I would rather die an honorable death as a bull than live one day as a gay bear.,
I think VisualMod could beat Biden in the primary.,
markets got that iPhone at 1% strength,
anyone have an extension cord I can borrow? going to take a toaster bath if anyone wants to join,
As someone with SPY calls, AH doesn't mean shit. I've gotten my hopes up on AH pumps just to see the opposite at openings. Hope I'm wrong though.,
This is what it sounds like when Guh’s cry,
For just $10 a day I will be your best bud and give you options picks that, if you inverse, you will be sure to win money, just let me know,
The 80k SPY puts guy living life rn if he didnt sell,
Cathie is on par with avg WSB investor

She hit big on tsla and alll her other picks she just buys the dip. And she’ll sell for a loss like most of the sub,
some of you have actual conversations with the robinhood chat messages and it shows,
Me with a few hundred: “I could be rich if I had more money in the market 
Me with a few thousand: “oh. I see. It’s me. I’m the problem”,
Global markets are poppin' off.

Today was not a collapse but a necessary correction. We resume the elevator climb past ATHs first thing in the morning bois.,
Green at night bears in fright,
In 2011 the combined market cap of the top 10 SPY components was 2.4 trillion.

Today Apple & Microsoft individually are worth more than that alone.,
It's beginning to look alot like Christmas.,
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Bonhomme7h (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 4.681899999999985 when it was 468.19 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.,
Let’s go NVDA,

#BEAR FUCKER, DO YOU NEED ASSISTANCE?,
That's it, I'm teaching my kids how to do fraud,

**NQ** (Nasdaq Futures) now at the same level (16400) as it was early morning yesterday before Jpow started speaking. All losses from yesterday reversed. And just 2% away from all time high.  
  
And yesterday you had this sub freaking out as if everything crashed by 20% or something, lol  
  
I shudder thinking what happens in these parts when we have an actual crash,
Won’t it be something is omicron ends up meaning nothing, supply chains push through and recover, and we find ourselves in a deflationary risk  situation by June ?,
Europoors deliciously green tonight, bears r fuk,
Spy up 0.38% ah, 🐻 fuk tomo,

depression,
Should have invested in barrels of maple syrup instead of oil,
It’s amazing that in this sub people just casually talking about loosing 10,20,50,100,1 million dollars and it’s just Normal but you tell that to a family member or friend and they’react like the world is ending 

It’s just fake magic numbers bro it’s not real! 

This sub has desensitized us to what a lot of money is lol,
Futes turning real and straight again.,
Jim cramer is a monkey dancing for his masters. Straight cuck.,
JPow got the job so he kept it real: Yeah, we got inflation out the ass. You politicians fix this shit. We’ve been running on cheap money and bullshit for 20 years. Who wants another trillion?,
Regardless of anything that happened today, it’s very interesting that apple hit an ath amongst all the red,
Bear r fuk!

Hello everyone. You may know me as that guy from the Big Short, but I actually have a name. I understand the market has entered depression territory, which I predicted 37 out of the last 1 times. I don’t want to tell you what to do, but I’m telling you to do that thing I did in the Big Short, lest you wanna be dining on delicious Taco Bell the rest of your life. Send donations to my dry cleaners, where I live.,
Funny thing is if you actually watch jpow’s comments he just said to retire the word transitory because people were interpreting it on their own timeline. He said they should just clarify from now on that it means the current inflation wouldn’t leave a permanent mark. Literally nothing actually changed except the markets interpretation of his comments and the word transitory.,
Holy fucking Green. Past 3 trading days absolutely nuts, looks like another banger tomorrow,
Futures are definitely heterosexual tonight. Another rip roaring day tomorrow 🤑,
Futures blood green, thanks for the dip buying powell,
This entire sub is yoloing NVDA tomorrow with me correct?,
J Powell tomorrow: What? Inflation? I thought you said steamed hams.,
Bear markets are no fun,
On the first day of VIXmas I lost all my tendies,
 Thank fuck life is transitory,
What the fuck is the government doing about these goblins coming out of the sewers, I’d like to know where my taxes are going because clearly they aren’t being spent on this sewer goblin problem,
# CHAZDAQ FUTES +1.53% 🚀🚀🚀,

Aaple singlehandedly saved capitalism today,
where are all the PHD educated people, who are significantly smarter than us, who told us that we were dumbasses for saying that inflation isn't transitory the last few months?

"the data says you are wrong, even the fed is straight up telling you its transitory you idiots" they said

kiss my ass you dumb fuks and you can shove your economics phd up your ass,
The market is angry with us because we lost faith, so let us pray:


Our Father who art in the **FED**

**JPOW** be thy name

Thy printers brrr 🖨️

Thy dip we buy

Today, as we did in 2020

Give us this day our daily tendies

And forgive us our 🧻🤲

As we forgive those that YOLO against us

Lead us not into pump and dumps

But deliver us from 🌈🐻

The Russians have arrived.,
The liquor is calling the shots now, Randy,
Bears in shambles. I am bear.,
Come to the conclusion that the only way to play options is to literally just play the most liquid / biggest names. 

Solely trading SPY / QQQ / AAPL / NVDA / SHOP / AMZN / IWM has worked out so much better for me than playing anything else. You're able to be so much more consistent. 

Also as someone with less than 25k in an account, I've started only ever buying plays that I think are high risk at the end of the day. That way it takes emotion out of it with regards to day trades. 

thanks for reading my blog.,
Will Tesla just keep going up forever? I bought puts because the valuation is absurd. Not the first person to make that mistake I reckon.......,

I won't be surprised if SPY goes +3% or even red for the day. Loving this volatility.,
I truly believe the Jeffrey Epstein stuff is true. These old men always looking at teens in the mall. There's almost zero doubt about how real that stuff was. Some rich ass fuck says "bro  we can do that on an island, nobody will know"... my mind hurts jus thinking bout it,
Normally this taper news would've been offset by sales results of Black Friday/Cyber Monday but all the deals are absolute dog shit and consumers know it. There's no shopping enthusiasm anymore, no more $1,000 TV being sold for $100 door busters, no opening Thanksgiving day, no terminators fighting postal worker for the last turboman. 

Retailers would say oh demand was weak this year. Yeah no shit demand is weak if the supply offered is weak as well.,
If you told me a year ago I’d lose $28k id laugh and say where the fuck do you think I have that lying around.



Now I can straight faced tell you, I don’t have $28k.,
NVDA and Apple being life savers again ❤️‍🩹,

This user has -3 comment karma lol.. People don’t like his talk of SPY Puts hahaha,
Much more likely to see 500 than 400 by eoy,
WHATEVER YOU SAY 🏳️‍🌈🐻,
!RemindMe 6 days

I cant wait to see the loss porn!,
You think the year is going to end bloody 🤔🤔🤔,
Can’t wait for Santa to crush these. 🎅🏼,
no doubt about the crash the question is when ...this year or next year!?🤷‍♂️,
You gonna turn some gain porn into loss porn if you don't take the profits on those Dec 31 puts,
Dude please take profit, one 2% day and you're broke,
Your not going to enjoy looking at the premarket,
How do these Spy 400 puts have any value at all ? If spy goes to 400 EOY we have the fucking apocalypse.,
Guh,
Fake economy. House of cards will come falling down.,
Cant wait till you lose it all ATH eow 🌈🐻.,
Hope you sold.,
You have a lucky second chance. Sell half at least this time.,
Expect a full pump on hump day baby !! We going still up.,
 Na it will be back up tomorrow. Then drop again Thursday. There is some major arbitrage going on.,
Unfortunately, SPY DGAF about what you say either. Are you enjoying your time in the casino?,
ALL U HATERS CAN SUCK MY DICKKKKK!! I KNOW MY TRUTH!!!! 8% MORE TO GO!!!,
Just sell it, nothing wrong with 57,000+ in profits. You don't have to wait for them to expire. You can sell any time.,
Soon the entire US economy will be in Tesla,
Lol first time huh? I remember back when I didn’t know about the money printer yet.,
Hahaha fuck your calls,
Here to wishful thinking it claws itself back by Thursday.  Nice job. Better this photo then loss porn.,
I am from the future & I’m here to tell you the market will crash,
Where is your banbet?,
Every time I have tried this I held too long,
I like the part where you post your average price and quantity rather than clipping the screenshot into 1/3rd,
We will correct 10-15% then ATH by january-feb 2022,
Place a ban bet then,
Lord almighty.,
Good luck getting fucked in the ass if you hold those for too long. If they work then good job retard.,
Futures disagrees lol,
RIP,
Oh you poor soul,
Everyone here is so bullish, these will print.,
Congrats on today,
How did you make money on $400 put?,
In with SPY puts as well. Let's go!,
That's a ballsy bet OP. Personally I think a crash this year is possible but unlikely. My SPY puts are for Dec 31 2022. Short term puts on YANG are better bet. Next fall will be the big SPY collapse.,
pls sell, jpow says market going up, this is just a cyclical downtrend. it has 2 more days top,
This guy hates money,
Can’t wait for Christmas to Fuck all the 🏳️‍🌈🐻,
No one knows anything.  Bu we do know hedge funds wants to pump before xmas to increase their year end bonuses,
[removed],
I done get it: how does he have a put with a $400 strike and is Itm if SPY is currently $457??,
Me2brothagodspeedretard,
The classic, is right once and thinks they know the market gambler.,
My AAPL 162.5 put is bleeding 🙃 shoulda bought spy instead,
That isn't how this game works. Jpow would need to stop printing money AND burn a trillion dollars in a crater behind the federal reserve.,
Sell you ape 🦧,
Pay respects 🙇🏻,
You are exposed to JPOW. If he Print, U fuk,
God damn full retarded 🐻🤡,
!Remindme 31 december,
Spy hits 400 I'm buying leaps 🚀🚀🚀🚀 SPY has that make you humble tendencies lol,
So I do think there is a possibility for $440 since the monthly closed on a shooting star - but I dont think it goes much further than that. Not sure why you wouldnt get a better strike with the amount you threw down.,
You better hold 
You are gonna be a millionaire boy,
My paper hands will never know such glory,
Good job mate, hold steady till at least SPX 4400!,
So… buy $400 calls and $460 calls?,
Good I will buy,
Tomorrow will be green.,
Remindme! 10 days,
mm will fuck u be4 it hits 400,
Not this year,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
You looked at futures tonight?,
Dec 24 18’ repeat trust me bro or ban me for life,
When your spy puts are up 200% but your entire portfolio is down 1000%,
!RemindMe tomorrow when you’re homeless,
bro I’m sorry but absolutely not…,

On fucking Chegg? You threw 800k on chegg?,
Good luck!

Promise to post the porn.,
Lol if you have 800k, you literally can make a better investment decision. Yes, this is financial advice.,
Your life is perfectly fine if you have $800,000. Fuck off,
Chegg this dick fucker. 800k smh,
Dude just sell 280 covered calls for 35$ 12/17. Make 9.8k profit since its currently at .35. Get called away at 35? Profit 140k+9.8k= 149.8K. Dont get called away and only make 9.8k? Rinse and repeat.,
Settle for the loss & spread that 700k into dividend bearing stocks.

Use the other 60k for retarded yolos.

Send the remaining 20k to me for this advice as I'd love to pay off my remaining student loans.,
Fortune favors the bold, good luck,
You have 800k to throw on Chegg. No matter what happens, you'll be fine.,
Jesus man. Strap your helmet on tight and Godspeed, retard.,
I'd rather be poor than stupid anyday, this man has chosen both.,
Good luck retard. I’m right here with you with 20k worth of CHGG calls,
This company has lost 75% from its high. Its hit the bottom. Only up from here,
Are you the guy from the lightning round ? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
You are playing safe. You will make good fortune 👍🏼,
This might be genius - it looks like it’s trending upward the past few days.  Could be huge!,
This man is onto something. $CHGG hasn't seen lows like this since the extreme lows of the March 2020 correction, and before that, 2018.,
Good luck tard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Bro do you foresee US govt canceling/closing all Unis and ask students to subscribe to chegg for their education in the near future?

If you have insider information please let me know.,
Ye ole chegg chug,
You are in a better life,
Almost a profitable company with revenue increasing yoy looks pretty good,
Where do people like you get money?,
Goddamnit you listened to Cramer on Mad Money yesterday didn't you,
this reminds me of when all the big WISH yolo's came in out of nowhere

all the big CLOV yolo's

accounts with no wsb post history then all of a sudden 1 mil yolo's lmfao fuck off u hf shill,
Buying CHGG too.,
Anyone have the chegg password? 
P!,
You gotta chegg yourself before you wreck yourself!,
Your portfolio is gonna get stitches when you bet on snitches.,
Used chegg all day today, Doing my best for yoy,
Gl!,
Are you betting on Online exams and people will use chegg more so their stock price will rise,,,, Or u must be a insider ,,or Dumb,
You don't need luck when you have autism,
And they are doing a buy back and just announced a acquisition. Think it’s gonna print soon,
Chegg is doomed.. universities are sending students to judicial affairs for it past few years.,
Chegg??? That thing dying,
Chegg might coming back if they sell this Covid bullshit again,
Chug Chegg Chug Chegg Chug Chegg!!,
What a fucking moronic hill to die on,
If you got 800k you should probably make some better investments,
LOL, dude that's just dumb as fuck, break a leg out there - or better yet wait on the loanshark you got the 800k from to come break your legs,
You already have 800k....just throw it in the sp500 and jerk off,
I hope for your butts sake that it goes up,
Is this ur life savings? Why CHGG?,
Wtf. Damn. How come u have so much money? Did u use margin?,
Isn't this a Cramer pump?,

If only there was some indication that China might do something like this,
Its all about data protection.,
Alibyebye 👋,
china stocks be fuck,
So what will happen with existing Chinese companies?,
Big rape,
Daily dose of Bloomberg FUD. “According to sources familiar with the matter” articles never have any substance. They don’t have news so they are literally making it up as they go,
What is going on in China? 

* $BABA should be worth more than Amazon

* Alipay should have IPO'ed

Why are they doing this to me? I want to make money! Did the CCP just decide _"Screw tech companies; screw money and e-commerce."_,
Title should be "China bans Firms from foreign ipos". 
Fuck the CCP,
> China is planning to ban companies from going public on foreign stock markets through variable interest entities, according to people familiar with the matter, closing a loophole long used by the country’s tech industry to raise capital from overseas investors, Bloomberg News reports.,

Loaded 100 shares in my Grandfathers Webull :),
I'm in. Calls on pussy,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Weirdos pay. A lot.

While perfect tits and abs bring numbers (and strong financial fundamentals), they serve as the foundation to whales with weird-ass kinks that will shell out some serious green to get their itch.

If done right, Centerfold will just need to be sexy enough in UI and curated content to get the average user in, but hopefully not so much so that they stiff-arm large portions of their more fringe (but not *too* fringe) customers.,
Ha didn't know playboy was still a thing crazy,
OK motherfucker, Im in,
Yyyyeeeeeaaahhh boooooiiiiii,
Great stuff, thanks Penny!

Just put on some 35-40 and 35-45 December calls. I think this has potential to run, but I’m worried about market-wide corrections, hence the tight(ish) spreads and low caps.,
TL;DR, Post some pics!!,
Already all in,
Looks like a new-tech take on an old trope, the Playboy Key Club.  You bought the club membership, they gave you a key, and you could go in any time and be brought a cocktail by a chick wearing heels, a leotard, a bustier, rabbit ears and a fuzzy tail.  It was a money maker for a time in the '60s.  

They are bucking a tide, with #MeToo, cancel culture, anti-trafficking, and radical feminism - Gloria Steinem pretty much killed the key club scene single-handedly - but a lot of that stuff infiltrated the pages of the mag too before the re-org.  I tend to think men will always want to peacock out and spend conspiciously in front of hot young girls, so if they can get hooked into that they ought to be able to leverage a steady stream of FCF. 

If they can get hooked into it and at the same time make a safe space for those men to virtue-signal and still get what they want, they'll make a trillion.  No one's quite cracked that code yet.,
WWE is worth $3.7B. PLBY is currently worth $1.5B. Are they worth the same? I am not sure how to think about the potential. WWE is mature with long term TV contracts, decent streaming platform, good merch. PLBY will be streaming and merch. It is not crazy to think PLBY should trade at a comparable value to WWE which would mean a $80-100 stock price.,
Penny only time will tell. A lot of people just wanna hate and pretend they are above it while ignoring all the available information out there. The brand is strong, the product will offer much more venues for creators to monetize their own content under the playboy brand (vs Onlyfans) and the management team has been stellar until now. Let the haters hate until they FOMO  at the top like the dumb retards they are. Great DD as always,
I get ads on Facebook all the time about playboy NFT's. Could just be triggered by my browsing history. Loading some calls.,
can't wait for Playboy metaverse,
Oh, I also forgot to mention this: [The first Playboy issue was **December 1**, 1953](https://i.imgur.com/Obm1rQ5.png) -- which is another reason to believe it launches tomorrow.,
CCs can post same content to both platforms and double bank…yea I’m in too great DD and catalyst follow up. Thanks!,
I've seen a lot of Playboy DD's in the past, but yours made me the hardest.,
I'm so salty I didn't know PlayBoy is public. Last year in the summer I wanted to invest in anything porn related because I assumed people would be going nut crazy. 

This is legit, and if their centerfold has even a quarter of the OF userbase this is legit. 

Thanks for sharing.,
I just bought ten of the $50c 12/17, not a WSB YOLO but I like what you've posted!,
I didn’t yolo when first DD came out. But pretty darn close. I’m jacked.  Pennyether knows his shit,
Alright fuck you im hopping back in,
Why it go down >:(,
But people are already on onlyfans. As a marketplace platform, OF has stickiness with both models and users. 

How will this be different from Mixer failing to kill Twitch?,
Sold some SPY to grab some of this.  Looks promising, thanks!,
Sitting on shares at $30 and $36 take us up :D,
ok you've convinced me to yolo yet again,
Well…. This ain’t going well for my calls,
I’m down! Let’s see those center folds be greeen!,
Market is on the verge of crashing and y'all are in here talking about playboy lol.,
Idk about this one chief , it’s already up 15% past week and 50% past month. Don’t you think it’s priced in and it may just be sell the news event?,
Lana Rhoades had been leaving hints about this all over her Instagram. But she has nuked it with regards to an upcoming launch and the photo had her wearing a playboy bunny mask.,
In for 310 shares! It's not much, but it's all the extra powder I could do. Let's go boys and girls!,
I got a few April 22 calls, good DD.,
Damn it, I’m in,
Holding 69 shares,
Bought 69 shares. Seemed like the right thing to do.,
Source: OP watches  porn,
Why would anybody move from OF? Are there any economics released that show that is a superior platform?,
Yikes, props to whoever front ran this post,
I played PLBY from $14 to $60 but sold everything. Have been waiting to see an opportunity to get back in,
🔥 DD,
>Expect some weirdos, though, 

I am SOOO fuk'n in.,
My dick is harder then centerfold will ever make it (wifes boyfriend does all the fucking) for jan calls lfg.,
In for $8k, let’s see what happens!,
Penny, your the man.,
Balls deep.,
I just ordered some of this and reflected on my portfolio. Weed, Internet, Sex. Nice.,
Man my dec calls are getting decimated.,
This post makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Been in since the 34s!,
Ohhh fuck I forgot about this and didn't get into calls.,
Will Apple and Google allow it in their app stores? Will Roku, Amazon, Apple and Google allow it on their tv devices? Hell, I guess I don't know if they allow only fans so I guess it doesn't matter.,
We call each other degens and yada yada but there's an ironic cuteness to it, an ode to capitalism and male testosterone blending together.

In reality there has to be a line drawn with how we profit and take advantage of other people's degeneracy. Making a publicly traded OF competitor is such a bad idea - you may as well give China a freebie to manipulate the average American mind a little further if they haven't been already.

Has anyone ever even considered what the average Chinese user gets recommended to them on tik-tok videos? They see videos of hard working Chinese people at shipyards, ports, manufacturing facilities, tech-hubs, etc. Their algorithm continuously promotes positive reinforcement of hard-working, generally positive trait incident visuals.

Have you seen what Americans get recommended? People shoving their faces in dog bowls and trannies calling you a bigot if you don't want to play cuddle with their pipeline and bearings.

I believe corporatizing degeneracy (if it hasn't already happened, yes yes I know we have MSNBC who's done the heavy lifting and other programmatic shows) but actively corporatizing sex work and continuing to pursue the cycle of simp-dom is not good for the general welfare of America or modern Western Society.

/endrant,
Wasn't OnlyFans about to disallow nudity soon or something like that?  Did that happen?  Is it still going to happen?  Because if it does, methinks a replacement geared directly at nudity is a no-brainer win.,
It’s happening! Going to the moon right now lfg,
I’m not sure why anyone would want to move away from OF since it’s already a well-established platform. It just seems unrealistic to expect sex workers to suddenly switch when they have an established client base already,
Beat them to it. https://allfans.com,
No cash now but I'll buy the dip and let it rip,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Where is the guarantee that they will allow sexual content like OnlyFans?,
u/pennyether you see the new [NFTZ etf](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/first-ever-nft-etf-launches-here-are-the-details-and-holdings-of-nftz-1031019915) has a 5.3% allocation to PLBY? one of top holdings,
Stock is already up 30% this past month and 282% for the year.,
Lol who the fuck is looking at soft core porn anymore. Everyone knows the big sites that house all the hardcore videos. Why would anyone pay for this shit when you can look at all the smut you want for free is beyond me?,
Plby isn't happening. Stop trying to make it happen. Too much free porn out there and cammers already got established fan/revenue streams,
Shit idea since the people who want to use it to attract and make money don't want it to be obvious/be known as a thing that is sexual.,
Argentium? 
PUMP AND DUMP,
Didn’t read but which platform offers better compensation to creators?,
Check their YTD. 264% Jesus fuck,
I'm up a grand on calls I bought this am.. scared it will all go to shit by tomorrow when ppl sell the news,
Unless they're willing to not take a cut from content creators for couple years and bribe famous titties like Jessica Nigri or Belle Delpine. I really don't see this working out. Microsoft tried to compete with Twitch with their shitty Mixxer and it shut down couple months later.,

Nah, I just buy whatever I see people talking about on here and listen to Jim Cramer.,
 As much as the EV subsides would make my Tesla shares worth more, I would rather see the build back broke bill thrown into the pit of fire.,
Tax the rich is what they say, fuck the middle class is what they do!,
The govt has demonstrated itself to be incredibly efficient and good stewards of the public's money. I see no problem here.,
Yeah sure, we LOVE joblessness, insurmountable debt and increased government control over our day to day lives! 🍆🍆🍆💦,
Bad direction. Cost of goods and labor are already up. Nothing in the plan addresses that, in fact, most of the programs exacerbate production cost increases. Lots of "temporary" programs, and we know how temporary government programs work (they are never temporary). Just seems like this is Biden's YOLO bill.,
👀 imagine trying to manage all this like they manage the dmv… that would be a shit show,
So the middleclass will get a tax break only to make it up in inflated prices? Let's go back to the record gains and low unemployment of 2018. Whatever plan we were doing then, just do that.,
Whatever Jim Cramer says I  usually buy the opposite.,
Hard to listen or believe someone who doesn’t know where he’s at half the time and shits himself,
Anytime the government steps in to “help”, I’m out.,
Unless Build Back Better is about improving the quality of ass implants I'm out.,
This will have a massive increase on COGS, worsening inflation and forcing Papa JPow to hike rates to 5%+. Recession would be guaranteed.,
Blocked,

My favorite is that little hiccup in July/ August.,
see you in the morning,
Dec 1 $468 strike calls on spy are $5 buy 5. Good luck.,
This is what people mean when they say first ones free. Or in your case, 3 times and you still managed to lose it all,
Find some deep OTM nickel options baby. Fat lady ain’t singing yet!,
how do i check that on my thinkorswim?  
is ToS the same as td ameritrade?,
😂😂😂,
10% cash. Dry powder. A wise investor indeed.I,
Don't be down on yourself fam. I lost that much money too but it was hard earned not trading options Bs. I'm up 5 times the amount I've had before the loss,
Double top...,
hahah looks eerily similar to my chart FML ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
Would you…or will you.  See you after your next paycheck!,
*WILL you do it again,
Where’d you lose your money?,
WILL you do it again? More than likely.,

Is this a yolo for ants ?,
Bro the weekly 165c are fucking insane 400k volume wtf thats the most ive ever seen. If only I saw this earlier in the week I would have YOLOd, instead just bought some 1/22 170c,
Come back when you sell them,
BOOOOOO!  
More money at stake please,
Hey I have some of those bought at .11 tho,
My guess is we will hit $180 in the first 5 trading days of Dec 2021.

Then $200+ by New Year 2022,

Thanks for playing at the casino..have a nice day,
You belong on this subreddit,
 Using a used Mercedes?!?!  From one bad financial decision to another.,
Buying a Mercedes is a full ape retard move. Congratulations. You get more retarded everyday!,
This is why Lotto Winners can't have nice things,
I could only max of 800$ of gme as a college student and you lost my entire 6 years of school tuition in months.

Wow, life is weird.,
Jesus Christ, thanks for this I’m gonna quit before I blow up my account… I don’t wanna be poor again,
Hope you saved some money for the tax man,
This graph is a representation of all hopes I had for 2021, not just financially.,
same shit happened to me. Bet on NCLH. Covid never ended and I didn’t predict the gov’t would hyperextend covid forever. $800 to $130k back down to $0,
I want to insult you, but I'm sure you're kicking your own ass better than I could. For the love of god if you aren't going to put your profits in something safe, put them in your pocket.,
At least your enjoying the ride,
Lmao E300 typical,
> I will not quit though, I will be back

Theta Gang: yes please!,
Used Mercedes’ 17 bad move dawg should’ve used that to make more money,
At least you are having fun 😂,
It sounds to me like you have a problem, aka addiction.  Seek help before it’s to late!,
Great post because it's a warning to other people not to be greedy and\\or stupid.

And don't chase the loss!!!,
How about you just give me half your money, I'll kick you in the nuts (or pussy, and we'll call it even?,
Thats how its fucking done,
Jesus, man. Control yourself,
See the key is to take out like 75% of your earnings and only play with the remaining 25%.,
What a rush, well done,
guh kirby :(,
Nice. I also won and lost $100k on gme. Didnt even get a car out of it.
We didn't have to pay short term capital gains tax doe,
At least you have a sweet Mercedes now,
thanks for easing my pain,
Enjoy the car man. Alot of people dont know what theyre talking about when it comes to foreign cars. I got my 2014 e350 for 10k with 90k miles on it. At 130k now and have had no issues.,
Should of held,
How to become homeless 101,
I also made about 100k from gme and did not lose it...Whats your wife up to?,
You’re retarded. 😮‍💨 you’ll go places here,
Man I felt bad because I "only" made like 10 grand in January but posts like this confirm that my risk tolerance is right where it needs to be. You should really stop trading for a while if your instinct upon getting a large windfall is to purchase a liability like an expensive car and yolo on options you don't understand,
fyi, you bought an "economy" model mercedes. i dunno if that matters to you but it matters to anyone impressed by mercedes.,
No system means no consistent profit.,
Why is this allowed here again?,
https://tenor.com/bfAGU.gif,
Sheesh what an idiot,
Goooooooddddd,
Gamblor wins again,
Take a mortage and go all in, you got it chief, this time your luck will turn around, I promise you.,
Lambo doesn’t start with an E300. Hodl .. live long and prosper..,
You're more retarded than me. I've only lost about $10k. Was only ever up a few thousand here and there. Posts like this make me feel almost lucky. Sorry about your losses,
you know what they say about selling,
hope you dont have any wash sales,
don’t yolo man,
You should have questioned your judgment when you bought an E300. 🤮,
looks like my portfolio but less money. i was waaay up and now just breaking even cause I never sell anything.,
I was very close to picking up a 17 e300 this year… glad i didnt,
At least you have a nice place to live!,
Thank you come again,
How did you manage to lose $100k in profits?  Unrealised gains by not selling and then seeing it plummet down??,
nice one,
Expecting a nice bonus are we?,
> used Mercedes

LOL new to luxury cars, huh? Why don't you just slam your dick in a door?,
Thanks! Without contributors like you there would be no winners either.,
Good job! 👍,
Should have bought a used Camry.  You won’t be able to afford the repairs this winter with the 95$,
Feels the past week I lost my entire years worth of gains back to flat lol May just sell in jan for the write offs against other income,
Let me try…I made 109k with gme stonks, invested my winnings in index funds and made an additional 20k.,
Options, F,
This is WSB! Always possible to get it back,
This is it.,
S&P +25% ytd, you are -99%. 
Stop. 
Get some help.,
you should really try to buy stocks that go up.,
You really blew the opportunity to change your life forever,
This is what happens when you only think about potential wins and place 0 thoughts on potential losses on your trades. Better luck next time OP. 

*unzips*,
Wow that is insanely stupid.,
It’s always the used baby benz they go for smh,
At least you got a car out of it lol,
Why not just stay in GME?,
" I'll be back. Back to lose more money."  \~Lossinator,
At least you ended up with a car bro,
Damn they got you on clov huh should’ve hodled,
Taxes?,
Can I get you another Coca Cola on the house?,
You really think the street was gonna let you run off with their money? RIP OP 🙏,
I bought shares in C O earlier in the year and definitely regret it.  Only stock I'm underwater on currently,
There are no new 2017 e300's left.  They are all used by now.,
You burnt your ticket out of poverty, welcome to the club brother!,
E300? Wow you must hate your money,
My fellow ape you truly belong here,
You will win. I believe in you.,
If someone came to me in January and said "draw what you think apes' charts will look like at Christmas," this is exactly the chart I would've drawn.,
The house always win in the long run.,
Seems like you hate money.,
I did the opposite, pocketed $100k from GME, not sold those, and funded 2 IRAs to 18k each, and computershared 44k Gme, while removing my original 40k seed money for dividend reinvestment plans.,
Wait, no joke you went in on Clovis?!?!? So sorry man, you know they’ve had past class action lawsuits? My buddy lost a ton and pissed on their offices front door,
Dude, you are just full of bad decisions, one right after the other. Please seek help if you need to (seriously),
genuinely curious.  what made you lose the most money?,
Theta gang sends their regards and thanks you for the donations.,
Don’t mind me, I’m just violently beating off to loss porn while listening to slipnot.,
Playing the market just might not be for you Sunny Jim,
Didn't anyone tell you to inverse Cramer and msm? As soon as CLF hit his show I knew I needed to sell within a month. Sold at the relative top thanks vito.,
Wow we have similar stories,
That’s why I took all my GME gains, paid off my debt and started from 0.,
Yep. Financial education is important 😂,
😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡,

I need a strike and a date. I can't read this,
What in the fuck. I can basically smell the Adderall through my screen.,
So SPY go back up?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
I don't know what any of that means.  All I know is another failed no nut November will be behind us soon kings, and stocks only go up.,
Looks like this cow has been milked. Call time,
someone did their hw ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
What you are looking for is lube, not help,
You have achieved WSB nirvana,
Uninstall. If you don't see it, they don't see it.,
Start by selling your Tesla, Rolex, AP watches, and then learn how to suck dicks.,
Holy shit, I hope you're a millionaire and this was just play money for you. F,
Can't feel any pity with your recent post history.,
You’ve done the thinkable. Classic WSB degenerate. I applaud you.,
The trick is to not understand what the hell you're looking at. Big numbers are good! You're doing great!😀,
6 figures in debt is nothing to scoff at. Welcome to the hall of fame, buddy,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
Wtf did you do?,
Farewell my friends. 
Been a great run. 
I've failed.,
F,
Always interesting to see what the OP has posted previously whenever there is loss porn.   


Look out for some watches on the cheap.,
You have unlocked lifetime membership. Congrats 👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉,
Sell a few watches and your 2 cars and go back in. Pussy.,
Look at OP’s previous posts. All posts asking what  Roley’s he should buy. Get the fuck out of here that you need help from this loss. Sack up like a true WSB degen and go take all your Roley’s to the local pawn shop and double down pussy. 

Post your new position when you do 😉. Oh yeah and don’t be a 🌈🐻 with your positions either.,
sell those watches,
Remember, bankruptcy is always an out.,
It's only money bro..,
Does this mean you borrowed money to buy puts on the SP 500?,
Sit tight for a little bit and inflation will fix the problem for you. Mid 2022 you owe 2 ice creams and a Mars bar,
Try turning your phone upside down and leave it in rice,
Lol this Degen spends money on flashy Rolex and seeks help? Bruh I don't feel bad for this guy. Get owned .🤡,

Ignore, tell them you're color blind and the app just looked blank,
" I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY",
What was your position? It’s gotta be retarded,
Just factory reset your phone man,
Ring ring it's margin bitch 😈,
I’ll give ya $50 for the Rolex and your wife to help out bro.,
Damn, I hope OP wasn’t seriously looking for help, because if he was, this is the absolute ass-last place to look for it.,
Uninstall the app and move to Mexico,
Should’ve spent less money on sneakers and rolexes mate

Maybe then you‘d have enough money to cover the margin call,
on a serious note -

https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/,
Way to go retard!,
You don't need help..... You need $450k.,
Felt bad until I checked your post history. WSB degenerate Stolen Valor is worse than real world stolen Valor. GTFO,
You still got those watches?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Idk if I like the design of this new lambo but price tag looks right, nice car!,
Banks are big ATMs if you’re brave enough,
Tell me you're retarded without telling me you're retarded,
Going through your history, you can afford a lot of Rolex and AP watches. You even have a mining rig. You’re fine, you can lose another $400k and still live comfortably.,
well his wife bf will be mad,
Head on over to your local Wendy’s and see Carl back by the dumpsters,
Congratulations you have officially entered and have been promoted to "Retarted God Gold Level" please step your right, bend down, lie on the ground and enter the feeble position,
I've held out for so long. Just one day left for no nut November and you made me violate it.,
Squid Games season 2 is taking applicants,
Where do people get this type of money to bet ?,
Is this a real Guh or paper trading Guh?,
Oh…..my…..,
😳,
Holy shit. Legendary!!!,
No, what you need is money,
Guh.,
What you really need is a hug and a shoulder to cry on. Have you tried checking out the Wendys dumpster by chance?,
I’m sorry for your lose. If you need money I can always buy the AP off you.,
Quick, move to an Asian country where red means gains.,
Jesus Christ man.. 

Really are a degenerate. 

F,
Look at the bright side, you won't have to pay a lot in taxes! Red numbers are much more tax efficient than green ones.,
Hope you like Mexico.. Best get driving,
Psst... I can help you. Seriously. Just meet me around the back of the Wendy's.,
Your up 300 bucks for the day,
Wow ty for making me feel better, good luck your next life,
Fuuuuuck running options on a margin account. It’s like playing Russian roulette by yourself but with somebody else’s gun.,
What you needed is a heroin addiction, an intervention, detox, then rehab...........it would have been cheaper,
I'd suggest a good bankruptcy lawyer.,
I got one of these today too. I don’t mean to be a dick, but I feel much better about my situation after seeing this. Thank you.,
This makes my dick hard,

Just don’t answer the phone,
Looks like it was futures that gapped down overnight
Op pray for a recovery tomorrow in sp500, and hopefully before you get liquidated,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Find this man a Wendy's,
How,
What happen,
You win this game.,
Ignore it. Stocks only go up.,
Thanks you make me feel better about myself,
Don’t worry, you’re safe here,
Yeah, I wish that goddamn Moderna fuck would've kept their mouth closed,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
Puts on this guys account,
What happens when you go this broke? 

I assume your trading platform has to make up the difference then they take your house wife kids dogs and cat? 

They then sell them to the highest bidder and then figure out how many years you have to work in the salt mines to pay off the rest?,
Sell your house and go all in on the opposite. Either way the market moves you will breakeven. Or worst case scenario. Just file bankruptcies,
You *need* 430 thousand dollars.,
I'm down 10k this month and thinking about rope. How do you guys do it?,
damn you should have bought SPY. then you'd only be 43k down.,
I am so sorry 😂😂😂 I completely zeroed out on Friday too(from snp calls) hahahahhah FUCK THE SNP BRING MY BONEY BACK,
Declaring personal bankruptcy is a start. Then begin selling off assets. You might want to get another job and have your wife and her boyfriend get a job.,
🤢🤮 here I am complaining about my 150k loss ..I guess there is light at the end of the tunnel,
Sir, you don’t need help. You need a miracle.,
Hope your wife's boyfriend let's you borrow some money,
Can we get an update, I need some material.,
Me too. We need a Wall Street bets support group. But seriously though. Like can I call the gambling addiction helpline? Do they know what call options and tendies are?,
Dude.  I straight up hope that is pocket change for you.  If not, you should be feeling greasy and not so fresh right now.

I recommend start seeking additional jobs to pay it off as quickly as possible.,
This guy probably roping in his garage by now,
Delete the app. Problem solved.,
This thread just got me back into wsb,
43,167 guys you gotta service behind Wendy’s to make that em call at 10 a pop.,
Identity theft is not a joke Jim..... but you should definitely consider it,
You have enough 3k annual tax deductions for like 143,666 years. Genius.,
You don’t need help. You need a priest.,
Hmm (430k) day loss anddddd (378k) available, looks like someone got burnt bc they didn’t understand max potential loss,
I lost 109k in two weeks :(,
You mother fuckers are ruthless cold blooded demons! Not waking up out of bed today-I’m rolling 😂,
I dont understand his positions. Did he buy daily calls on margin or did he sell naked Puts?,
That a boy! 😎,
Idk what that means but it makes me sad to look at it,
This guy is fine. 

✅ owns multiple rollies and audemars

✅ drives a Tesla and other exotic looking cars

✅ is Asian (family money)

✅ went full retard and gained the respect of wsb,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
futures are significantly in the red, market might be bloody tomorrow. not sure how much it’ll help ur case but maybe there’s some hope there,
This didn’t even get the karma it deserved,
This dude loaded up on spy puts Friday as the market dropped. Then when Monday hit. It wiped him out. The spy is down again a few points today so he should be getting some money back of he didn't sell for a loss,
just do math.abs(),
You need a therapist,
Paper trading account?  

I find it hard to believe that such retards actually exist.,
You need more than help,
Did you accidentally reverse your colors?,
Guh,
You'll be fine man, you can still bounce back. Work smarter not faster next time. You got this.,
GG OP,
Stay away from $rope,
Delete the app,
Tits gone vertical, nice.,
I heard home depot can help you out with some sturdy rope,
Ouch, you knew about the market and over leveraged funds and inflated stock prices and you still gambled the SPY???? Friday should have been an eye opener of what was coming, Monday was the fake out break to lure in the suckers ie: bag holders.,
How do u do this,
If you can get 379,000 people to pitch in just $1 in your goFundMe, you'll be golden. If not, you can prostitute yourself in OnlyFans,
Please! Stop! My dick can only get so hard!,
HOLY FUCK,
Fatality....,
You NEEDED help, now you need a new identity.,
Your wife’s boyfriend is disappointed,
You have over 4K shares I think you'll be OK poor baby,
Go Double or Nothing. Works every time.,
I hope you’re ok buddy. You can and will get through this.,
🥂welcome aboard, I’ll save ya a spot in the welfare line👊🏻,
You sure do,
Good luck! Guess your wife is available now, right?,
This gets me rock hard,
Bunch of fucking idiots.,
I'm a little scared, this market seems like a bunch of play and people will all run for the exits when things go bad.,
why are all ur gains in red?,
I don't see anything wrong here.. what do you need help with??,
Uhhhh.. you are fucked.,
I wish to have as much money as you’ve lost,
Could’ve just bought some corn or boomer stocks lol,
It's only a flesh wound,
Don’t gamble money you can’t afford to lose,
What. The. Fuck. Did you do,
Just stop whatever the F you  doing and buy TSLA,
Looking at your posts, this is probably a small portion of your account lmao,
Nice,
Just hold,
Post the details , don't give us blue balls,
Aint nothing wrong bro just hodl!,
Proud of you all,
So shall we collect a dime from every member in WSB? Nah we all know everybody is in some deep shit like this. Penniless.,
Did you try turning your cpu off and back on again?,
Mind if I use you as my "well, atleast I'm not this guy" thing?,
Umm... So how did U actually do that? Just asking for a friend.,
Just curious, what brokers let you do this? Even on my level 5 with margin account I get the “sorry, you don’t have enough buying power” message if I try to place a trade that will leave me this fucked. 

I suppose maybe it’s better I don’t know! 😂🤷🏼‍♀️,
See you at Wendy's fella.,
Now thats some good stuff,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Have you picked which bridge you'll jump off yet?,
So sorry, man.  You know that when we all say YOLO’d, it’s just a joke.  We’re not really…um, never mind.,
Just delete the app,
It's fitting that the color scheme for this photo is orange and black because you got royally fucked.,
Positions or ban fuckface,
How did OP get so much margin? Asking for a friend,
No you don’t need help!!  You need to lose the “show off” narcissistic routine.  Do you think you actually impress anyone over age 30 with your posts if a Tesla and nice watches?  I’m also willing to bet you don’t OWN much of what you post. Posting a pic of a bank vault doesn’t make it your money, or a Tesla at a Tesla dealership your car.
So go on posting hopeful posts and get back to work, there’s a spill on aisle 4.,
Imagine if this was green tho ☺️,
Cannot even find a word to say… i am sorry for your loss..,
Paper trading account,
What's the expiry?,
Only idiots trade in margin .  You deserve it,
Dang,
Hello, hope you are ok. when is the expiration.,
I’ll send help, here’s an up vote,
u need — a rope,
[deleted],
Oof we all been there bro,
[removed],
Oooof.,
This should become my flair. I need percentages.,
This is worthy of standing with the legends,
marge callin rn and she finna be pissed fr fr,
😬,
Never go full tard... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
The only help you can afford is "Pick a God and pray".,

Hey /u/lifeaquatic34, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Bitches are getting fatter by the minute, fuck, most of em are fat anymore; LEAPS,
This is interesting. I doubt most of the beta simps on this sub know anything about the female persuasion. They would miss great plays like SPANX. If there are any woman on this sub who will take this play seriously, I’d love to hear their opinions.,
Is it fast fashion or quality stuff?

The difference is large.  Fast fashion will change its line several times a year and used low quality materials.  It's the what's in and inexpensive sort.  The fast fashion is fucking cut throat and hit or miss I would avoid ... There isn't a good men's comparison I can think of

On the other hand if they are making quality clothing that would find space a few years from now on consignment racks I'd go long for sure, think brooks brothers etc.  There just aren't any fat women cloths stores that have good quality fashionable stuff.

Covid may present a large headwind though as the fashion forward and quality stuff won't be bought up in mass until the covid crap really does down.  Need a place to wear this shit rather then at home on screen

I will look into it for my own accounts

Not a women, not fat but did an MBA with a lead designer for a women's fashion brand in my cohort.  Learned alot.  Holy shit does fashion have high profit margins,
I thought covid killed fat people. Sounds like PUTs to me.,
This stock is going to rocket on Juneteenth,
It’s a woman’s clothing store.  It’s a fickle industry, with stuff going in and out of trend.  

There’s also a lot of fat chicks out there.  I imagine that they would much rather go to Macys or Nordstroms or something like that with clothes for all size ranges rather then shop at a dedicated fat chick clothing store.,

Loss is because you did not have 100% diversity. WISH senses the unfaithful and punishes them.,
Such diversity,
I swear I really thought it was bots spamming and pumping $WISH but after seeing all the $wish porn I have changed my mind,
Get in line bucko,
99% of Wish? Wow,
You already drew California down to Texas and further east. Time to finish and draw Florida where you can retire the account.,
I think you broke my screen,
Diary of a rekt man,
You $WISHed upon the moon and missed so bad you didn't even end up in the stars ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Yeah, I hate money too anyway,
Wish $20 and BABA$240,
Only -67% there's still another 33% to go! Don't worry, you can do it! 😂,
Nice loss porn,
I've got $50000, should I buy Microsoft? What about Visa? Hmm Apple could also be good. They all make billions of dollars and still somehow have room to grow.. so hard to choose. Maybe I should invest in all 3.

Nah, I think I'll buy 4300 shares of a dropship search engine full of the cheapest possible Chinese products.,
Sell now, buy more when it’s under $2,
You will make it back by next summer . Just hold up man . You’ll be alright.,
Hold my friend,
Stfu about  WISH.,
Soon your loss wil match the loss percentage on your battery. Godspeed Retard.,
Didn’t you learn not to put all eggs in one pussy?,
Soooooo you no fap but still make awful decision ? 

What is the point ?,
Fuck diversity!

I mean portfolio diversity.....,
The one good thing about wish is that I enjoy the  lossporn,
I have only seen wish loss porn on this subreddit,
*dead*,
Nice I needed thatemote:t5\_2th52:4276,
You could have bought 12000 shares today!,

The rules are made up as we go and the points don’t matter. This game runs until we stop believing in it. Santa Clause Syndrome,
All politicians are professional can-kickers.,
J Powell is searching on Google right now.  "What's Higher than a Trillion Dollars?",
I'll give u some noob advice because I fell for it when I started. Market has been quite parabolic the last month and cool down periods/corrections are a normal part of the market cycle. Don't think too much about "the market crashing" because news articles and YouTube videos come out every day saying there will be a market crash. Look at this on a monthly time frame and you'll see how many crashes perma bears are correct on: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMEX%3ASPY,
I can't tell you a time frame, but I feel pretty confident in saying one of these three scenarios will play out over the coming years:

1) Gut-shattering asset crash that makes 2008 look like the 2018 Taper Tantrum. Hoovertowns, but they'll call them Bidentowns. Two or three years of massive hardship followed by growth in the ruins as the smart and the strong survive and then thrive.


2) Mind-boggling inflation. Weimerica. Attendant social and political instability. Rainy with a chance of fascism. 


3) Japan's Lost Decade, but in America. Everything churns along "normally" but without creative destruction. Very low growth, essentially forever. Massive and widening wealth gap bordering on neo-feudalism. Zombie corporations propped by cheap debt roam the US landscape, eating the brains of all domestic competitors. US companies get crushed by more nimble foreign competitors abroad. Stagnation and decay.


How to financially prepare for these scenarios? Fuck if I know, what works in one fails in another. For now, read a book or some articles about Weimar inflation, the Great Depression, and Japan's Lost Decade. Consider studying Spanish, Chinese, German, or Bahasa.,
They mint a trillion dollar platinum coin and life goes on,
It’s just a bad game of hot 🥔 , except the potato is rotten.,
Nobody knows for certain. I’ve been in the game for 30 years and have never seen anything like what is happening now. I expected a much needed correction pre-pandemic (late 2019). These truly are unprecedented times. My assumption is that it’s either the end of the ride for everyone (like, for real), or just business as usual. Business as usual is either gains (crumbs) for us, or the tax payers pay the price for a few years while we argue amongst each other as to who we should blame. Know this: chaos is opportunity. If it feels like chaos to you, just know it’s a well-coordinated opportunity for someone else.,
Nothing happens. Politicians and the media makes a fuss, then literally nothing happens. It's all political theater that means nothing. Has been since before you or I or our parents were born.,
Stocks will definently only go up,
They pull the money vacuum out of the attic…. Zzzrrrrrrrr zzzrrrrrrr….,
Uh, money printer go brrrrrrrrrr after Nixon.,
We cant run out of money because we have the printer. They can always print more. Sure, inflation. Sure, devaluation. But people sitting up there are not noobs and it wont come to that. Dollar is worldwide reserve currency so we’re far far away from that point.,
Stocks only go up,
Money is exchanged for goods and services,
Just need to tighten up those boot straps, champ/sport/son.,
The money only runs out when China collapsed,
Beware... anyone who answers this question is selling something.,
Way more complicated than anyone can explain to your recycled cardboard brain.. if you’re worried buy silver and wait out the inevitable.. but will the silver to your future kids in case it gets kicked way further..,
If the treasury runs out of money, it’ll become the second Great Depression,
They can't run out of money. The Fed just makes more for them. The process is obscured behind a complex financial pipeline but it just amounts to conjuring up more dollary dos on demand. That's the wonder and magic of fiat.,
Print more money duh,
No crashes... just small adjustments...(Which are opprtunities)... Until you can get 8% yield outside the Market... the market will keep going up, then correct a few percent,
You can’t run out of something you can print at will.,
I'll loan them some cash. I have a few bucks sitting in my car for emergencies.,
Did you say "Treasury runs out of money"?.... My guy the Treasury ran out of money eons ago, they just keep printing with the Fed. Which is why the US national debt is unfathomable, the country couldn't pay off that debt within a generation. US is running on IOUs since the 70s. The only thing they can run out of is approvals from Congress to raise the debt ceiling.,
The fed can mint a $25 trillion coin and deliver it to the treasury.,

This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but when you think about it, it's much closer to a real yolo than just betting your life savings. 

If you lose all of your own money, you can go back to your day job and save some money and do it again. But if you put yourself in crippling debt that you can't discharge via bankruptcy, that's truly something that you can only do once in your lifetime.,
Absolutely retarded idea. Welcome home, brother.,
Going for retard of the year?,
I got a $15k loan from my bank to YOLO. Look at it this way, if it works out you'll probably be very well off, and if it doesn't you'll be eating ramen noodles for the rest of your life.

.....I currently lost my taste permanently due to all the ramen noodle flavor packets I've eaten.,
I'm smooth brained but I'm not THAT smooth.,
Sounds like you’ll get an education with that money, whatever happens.,
dont listen to them op, this is a great idea and if you lose all the money just delete your app and restart again. they legally cannot prosecute you if you do that,
I needed this laugh. Thanks.,
I took out 80k of private loans for LEAPS, not for yolo. Kinda similar,
Holy Shit that's retarded. If your going to be this stupid at least make a video for us to see.,
On the odd chance this isn't a shitpost...

If you're seriously looking for ways to take out a loan to gamble, it's time to step back and re-evaluate.,
This is a really good way to completely fuck up the rest of your life. I wouldn't even recommend people take out student loans for its actual intended use, let alone gambling.,
Everyone with a margin account did.,
somebody has to live behind wendys the rest of their lives. great idea ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Lose a lot of money - your problem 
Lose a fuckton of money - their problem 

I see this as An absolute win/win,
Retard if it doesn't work or legend if it does. That's kinda how it works around here.,
this is why the student loan issue in America is so messed up.,
just rob a bank , no debt has to be paid back at that point,
Congratulations, you've posted the most retarded thing I've read all day.,
Banker here. Student debt is the worst kind of debt because you can't just BK and get out from under it. They can and will garnish your wages to get repaid if you fall far enough behind.,
For entertainment purposes: What is your plan if you lose the 100K next day?,
Based on my experience investing over the past 18 months, this is a great idea. 

Based on my experience investing over the past 18 years…

Actually, you know what. Fuck it. Yolo.,
This is an absolutely stupid idea, but 100% on par with WSB behavior.,
Taking loans out this close to a bear market? Brave.,
Just max out your credit cards and if you lose all your money throw them in the lake so they can’t track you down. 😎,
It doesn't work that way. You can't get student loans for adult education, only for accredited degree programs. Furthermore, for undergraduate loans, your college tightly controls what you can spend the money on and how much you can borrow: you're not allowed to borrow more than your school's reported cost of attendance, which means that all of the money goes straight to tuition. And if you drop out, the school doesn't give you a check, they send the loan money directly back to the government.

However, graduate school loans are basically a free for all and they'll let you borrow basically whatever you want. So you need to get into graduate school first. Unfortunately, if you're actually considering using student loan money to gamble on Robinhood then you're probably so smooth-brained that you'll just end up eating your GRE test booklet so that's probably not an option.,
this is how you become a millionaire,
I did something similar to this in 1999. 
My senior year of college. 
I had no debt as I was on a full athletic scholarship. I applied for grants and loans. I received $2,500 in loans and $7,500 in grants. I put it all on AAPL.  My friend did the same, but he was  smarter than me. He went to whorehouse in Pahrump. He met a nice girl, paid some money to name a star after her. It was all she needed to leave her lifestyle and run off with him. They now live happily ever after with 3 kids and share herpes outbreaks with each other. They post them on Twitter. Kind of fun to read about.,
No this is stupid and fraud,
Is anyone dumb enough to take out a loan to Yolo deserves to lose all their money,
Yeah just dont take it to the casino and you should be good,
This plan sounds like a bad idea. Get a margin account and go from there, yeah it won't be as much but better that then getting into a frenzy with these loans, etc.,
I know a couple loan sharks that will help you recover if it goes south the first time around,
Just an FYI student loans do NOT ever go away. Bankruptcy, forgiven, etc… That money will follow you until you are dead! Judging by this terrible idea that won’t be too long. You’re better off YOLO at the craps table in Vegas than this retarded shit.,
Biden will forgive all your student loans, so it's a win for you.,
Rainfall futures? You've been hanging out with the gourd guy. Ticker please. I'm in!!!,
It is fraud if you borrow money for one stated purpose and then use it for something else.  VERY bad idea but I get the impression you are just looking for approval of your idea and will try to proceed anyway.,
Throw that loan into the stock options 😂 trust me bro you could pay off that debt in a week if it goes well 🦍🦧,
You can’t just get a student loan and blow the money in whatever you want.  Otherwise no one would get personal loans with higher rates.  Lenders will not give you cash, they will pay your educational institution directly - so good luck with this terrible plan.,
Do it. If it goes bad, it’s future FightMilkv2’s problem, not your’s.,
You're retarded to try and YOLO money that you can't declare bankruptcy out of

If you've got citizenship somewhere else, it may be an idea worth considering.,
Truly retarded.  Welcome home!,
If you were honest about why you want the loan when you apply for it, you’ll be instantly denied.

If you lie about it and then yolo it and lose it, your life is forever fucked and you’ll be really goddamn sorry you did what you did. 

On the .1% off chance it works, well, I’ll eat my words.,
Thank god for this sub and it’s beautiful ideas, we will all be rich very soon.,
Or… get a job and slowly invest what you can afford like the rest of us?,
Do it pussy!,
There is no way this can go wrong. Do it. Do it now!,
I fully support this. Put it all in PROG.,
\*googles gamblers anonymous groups near me\*,
Lol,
Tell me you don’t know what margin is without saying you don’t know what margin is,
I've done it but on a much smaller scale, just $30k. Now it's $154k. Not with student loans, but with personal loans.,
I don’t recommend it but that’s how I got started when I became confident. Took out money from my line of credit lol.,
atleast invest a portion of it into spy so you don't completely ruin yourself,
R E T A R D E D,
Fucking hell no,
Pretty sure the lending agency for school loans sends the check directly to the school.

But what do I know? That was twenty years ago when pickle puffer Barney Frank was in control of federal student loans.,
Still smarter than going to school and getting crippling debt and a shit job. Why not yolo it?,
Yes I took out a $20k loan to trade thinking I was hot shit and lost most of it and still have $9k left to pay. Don't do it,
It’s illegal to use those funds for investing.,
[removed],
Are you bipolar manic rn like there is no situation where using a student loan will actually net you profits,
I've definitely YOLO'd some of my subsidized fed loans after tuition is paid. I wouldn't take out unsubsidized loans to YOLO though.

In NY you need to attend a minimum of 6 weeks for the refund(at least in the SUNY network), this is to dissuade people from doing exactly what you're talking about. I've sometimes had to wait 10 weeks to get my refund, sometimes they're slow.,
Why not follow someone who does Options on Discord for a minimum monthly fee? Is the safest way in my opinion. They do the research and you just have to play it safe like they do and climb the ladder slowly.,
Approved.,
This is why we can’t have nice things,
When they come to get paid and you tell them you went YOLO with their money if will be fraud.  That isn't going to be fun, they will bend you over with interest and penalties.,
This seems like questionable decision making...

Edit: BUT, if I would have done that on any of several positions I have/had, I would no longer need a day job, so... 🤷,
That’s a lot.  I took out a student loan and went backpacking through SE Asia with it.  BUT my school was paid for through the GI bill.  I also took out a lot less.  It was annoying paying them off once I joined the workforce but now that they are paid off and I can reflect on the experiences I’m happy with the decision.  Would I do it for an investment?  Lol probably.  But I am quite retarded.,
This idea is moronic,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
If I had it to do over again, this is what I would do. You can always hope the debt gets canceled or you can file bankruptcy.,
Good luck on your endeavors young retard,
I literally love these posts.  Actually take a photo once a day in the mirror and correspond it with data of your losses.  For science!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Gambling student loan funds is fraud. You could face jail time if this goes tits up which of course it will.,
Terrible idea……so check out student loans on SOFI….then use the money to buy SOFI stock.  It is a cheat code.  I mean….they loan you the money to buy their own stock.  Its like free money.  You are welcome.,
You can’t discharge student loans in bankruptcy. This is literally the dumbest idea possible.,
Get Sofi Loan to buy SOFi stocks! What could go wrong?,
I've yolo'd 5 credit cards onto $GME.

&#x200B;

lol,
Puts on your life if you do this.,
Quick question - If a bunch of different people with no dependents take out massive loans, gamble it all away then kill themselves, where does the money go?

Does it just disappear since no one can pay it back?,
Surely the lender will have some sort of due diligence control in place to keep you from going uncle clap hands with their money...,
This is called a bubble loan and is illegal. Least I think.

Creating the paper trail is genius though. Keep it up.,
I took out a $50,000 loan to run the wheel on.. a stock I’m not going to name. It’s paid off more than I thought it would. However, I don’t recommend because this was before Covid,
worst part is, student loans had no interest since covid, yet spy continued to run to all time highs. If you would had bought spy with those loans back in 2020 you would have been golden.,
These are the type of ideas high-school entrepreneurs have,
No,
How about just operate on margin,
How to ruin your life 101.,
This is literally the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard….,
Might as well, lambo or bust,
I cannot officially answer this question.,
For the love of god, don’t,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Yea 25k loan to day spy calls,
Only an absolute degenerate would bet on the weather . I love it,
Just get multiple credit cards and personal loans. You could probably get $70k in just credit cards.,
First this is the dumbest thing you can do, if you don’t have the money, you shouldn’t invest.   Also you can’t get 100k in student loans at once.  🤦‍♂️,
That's retarded, I love it,
This is what caused the Great Depression. 
People were using their holdings as collateral to take out loans to add to their positions.,
Looking at your numbers and logic you are onto something. I took out a $27k HOME EQUITY LOAN to write puts and calls...its working. 

I set a date on my calendar to YOLO when I'm up to $50k. I believe in Jesus unlike you degenerates, and so I shall do his work.,
Better post evidence of you do it.,
Dumb.,
This is a great way to have your next post be loss porn,
I had 5k left of a 10k student loan I made 30k after I paid off my loan,
Seems smart. Go for it!!,
This is like the Tsar Bomba of bad ideas,  dude come on ......... let me know how it goes,
How to find ticker?,
Great idea 💡.Maximise your leverage by trading 100X future contacts on $SHIB,
Study “medicine” and get your parents to co-sign.,
Coolest shot I've ever read in my life !!!   Go for it and keep.us posted !!!,
You do realize they don’t just front load the loans for your entire degree... ah who cares. Go for it bro,
Dude, you belong here, welcome.,
Dont do it, it might sound like a great idea but dont. I am down 20k on borrow money,
What. An. Idiot.,
Hell yeah brother I got a 10k personal loan just to yolo baba,
I’m not going to waste my time reading that garbage, just do it,
I’ve heard you never have to pay them back if you just stay unemployed but I know nothing didn’t even finish 9th grade,
This is actually an incredible idea. 

It seems pretty likely that all studemt loan debt will be wiped out by the federal govt within 5 to 10 years anyways. So you could yolo and even if you miss - your debt might be wiped out by govt.

But i would probably diversify a bit. 

If you suddenly have that much money to yolo.....why not spread the money around. Sure do 10k on las vegas rainfall futures. But then throw another $10k on spy. And another $10k on QQQ. Today is the perfect day to buy both since they are on cyber week discount prices.,
If your this committed to this...at least let me know what your yoloing.. I have about tree fiddy I can yolo along w ya,
I thought I was smart taking out a 75k personal loan at 11%, but you sir are awesome.,
With one good bet you could get to $500k but the risk is too high.,
I love your heart champ,
God damn...is this real life? Or 'trolls gonna troll' situation? Lmfao,
Fucking do it, peak retardation. I yolo’d my 10k worth of Sallie Mae student loans last year on damn near all the recent meme stocks.,
Holdup! I've never taken a student loan, are they given as direct cash payments?!,
Pretty stupid but I have done it on a 3% loan and I am now paying it off while I wait 20 years to get my money back,
“Why was this moved to a shitpost”. Lol, what part of this post isn’t shit?

Buddy, you wanna pay for school up front, just to take out loans, drop out, and fucking ooga-booga it into god dam rain futures. 

Do, it literally can’t go tits up, make sure to use margin,
If you are getting loans to invest. You may have a gambling problem.,
Ok, first off, the amount of people on this sub whom can’t take a fuckin joke is rather alarming…
Secondly, rainfall charts til this moons and then I want pictures of decent strippers and grade a blow…
Bot set a reminder a year from today.,
Worst idea I've seen on this sub yet,
Party like it's 1921!,
No because although I am severely retarded I still have one brain cell to tell me thats a very bad idea,
Ik im autistic, but I’m not that retarded,
fuck it do it,
That’s called wire fraud and will land you some serious prison time along with some massive fucking fines.,
Please post the pics LMAO, this is actually the most retarded thing I've ever seen lol, so dumb it's bound to work, please solo it into options!,
This guy is why we get called apes.,
I was going to write something smart but then i remembered that this is WSB after all so i tell u....

Do it😅,
Go try the Casino,
This is a disastrous idea.,
How about going to med school. Way bigger loans and you could learn to remove your own kidney m.,
Go ahead, Dumbass! If you strike it rick, good, if not, fuck ya!,
Hit “Save Game” beforehand, so if you do lose all your lives you can just load to this point. I do it all the time.,

Good shit OP. Count me in.,
where rockets?,
Minor quibble: it's not really memory (transient, e.g. DRAM), it's storage. That aside, strong DD I'll check them out.,
This definitely looks like a find, but the first question that comes to my mind is how the chip shortage is affecting them. From your DD it appears they are a supplier not a manufacturer, correct? Do you have any idea how the chip supply is affecting their sales and profits?

They can have all the orders in the world but that doesn't matter if they can't get product to fill those orders. And even if they get product, rising cost could eat into their profits, and there's a real chance that chip price increases may linger for several years if not more.,

It's hard. If I believed in that stock and were in your shoes, I'd probably hold. But from the sidelines, all I see is $9k to salvage.,
#pltr call options aka the widow maker,
It's hard to believe you even stopped working with only 25k.,
The great news is that you have to be super young.   To Yolo on this and to think you can quit your job on 25 grand means you are probably 19.  I bet you are also looking into a weed store.,
Fuck me, daddy,
roll 9000 out to options for next year if you believe. Don’t hold this to death.,
Dude sell these and buy leaps for 2023 or 2024. Deep ITM with a delta at least 80 to 90.,
No mercy to PLTR bag holders lol 🤣 the way many of you guys worshiping Karp makes me want to puke 🤮,
Take that 9k and buy OTM AMC calls.,
:(,
turn that into shares and do CCs or lose the rest,
See you at Wendy’s!,
I got out a week ago...,
Ah fuk, this sucks, as a fellow Palantard I feel this. Although I knew the ride would be bumpy so I’m bagholding mainly stock and some leaps,
Bro you have 9k quit crying sell the bitch. Put your money aside learn the basics and quit chasing. Your still better off then most people here. Also your only allowed to apply at Wendy’s if these expired worthless so you have to apply at Burger King and no you don’t get free food!,
You needed a job with that initial amount anyways. No big deal.,

The metaverse already exists. It’s called videogames.,
I love how you link to Facebook rather than the original upload... That's so meta.,
Of course it will fail.  It's the same mistake all tech-bro businesses make before they fail, and that is, expecting the user base to drastically change the way they do things, rather than integrating into and complementing whatever they are already doing.,
Second Life has been around for quite while now.,
Am I the only one that thinks the whole metaverse thing is going to flop completely and look like everything "cool" from the 80s in 10 years?,
Methaverse is better,
Is it because I refuse to login to Facebook even to read this stupid article,
It's all an elaborate scheme to take your money in a virtual world. Companies will set up shop in these virtual worlds sell you virtual products at no marginal cost, but it will equate to real dollars for them. Been done before, but not marketed at scale to the everyday person who doesn't play video games or that isnt up to speed on the dynamics of tokens or crypto. Some of the implications are interesting, but the scam is real.,
I’m just ready for everyone to start questioning if we’re already in a simulation and to actually prove it but I believe it was stated we wouldn’t be able to disprove it. I’ve had some OBE experiences that make me believe something similar. Just like the movie the 13th floor,
Rumor has it there’s already a way you can interact with 3D individuals, do things, and buy property when you step into this thing called “real life”,
Did anyone heard about world of warcraft or second life? Metaverses sucks and destroy you from your guts.,
The fact that the video is on FB is gold.,

Glad I kept my beeper 📟!,
Apple won before they started,
Can I just go around in the metaverse stabbing these people while they’re in their conference calls ? You know GTA vibes…,
Good, fuck Facebook/meta whatever it's called...,
We r in a sim,
How much time can a person spend on VR? At work? On the train? In a restaurant or cafe? At home ignoring the family? It's even more limited than a full-on gaming rig. And Suckerborg's acolytes don;t have the nerve to tell him he's not the best face for advertising the new path. Most people think he's either weird or just generally dislike him. Crash and burn.,
Zuck's vision for Metaverse expands beyond just 3d-worlds. The difference lies in the access-point to that world - as well as it's borders with the real world which are meant to be fluid in the metaverse (eg. the tech). Saying PUBG and all the mobile games of Tencent is the same as fully immersive and borderless AR/VR metaverse is just plain dumb.

Source: I'm a Meta employee (not working on Metaverse, though),
Zuck got Zucc-ed,
I dint have Facebook dude can you please paste the article?,
Zuckerberg trying to be like RC. He wants in on what's to come so tried to hurry and get ahead of it, now he'll just get ran over... oops.,

Buy apple and do yourself a favour why make things complicated,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Why do you retards keep buying this shit? It was bad enough when the money printer was on, now we’re barreling into volatility and uncertainty and y’all are tripling down on meme stocks. 

FFS 0DTE spy plays are smarter than this shit.,
I didn’t know it was already under $5. Good lord it’s going to hit $3 so fast lol,
I think it’s time to let go…,
I hope we don’t see a reverse stock split,
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

You could've bought TQQQ with the same money and get your money back faster.,
It's funny how ppl go from being super positive to overly negative. I think you'll be fine in the long term, Clov seems to be a decent player in the market

I'm also going to buy the dip if it stays this low this month,
I hope you moon harder than any stock has ever mooned.,
You are so fucked... loss porn going to be epic.,
I research Clov awhile ago and I thought they looked pretty good. I don’t think there’s a reason for them not to shoot back up,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
This thing continues to suck money out of idiots.

Have fun having a stock that wont even be profitable until 2024(by their own admission).,
CLOV motherfuckers!,
CLOV is the WISH of healthcare.,
You will be poor(er).,
Going to 68 cents that is,
cut your loses,
Get 1165 more shares,
OP may be the next DFV.,
Waste of money,
Kind of new to investing, could Clov go to a negative price or is zero the floor? Iirc some oil stock or etf went to a negative price, I'm ok with losing 95% but losing like 107% would stink,
Haha what a dumb fucking fuck,
No such thing of $CLOV apes. Just $GME $AMC take that loss n get back in THE PRICE IS RIGHT BIATCHHHH,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Why didn’t you just buy nvda calls smh,
What do I see in this company ?,
Clov clov clov clov clov gang 🍀,
Don't use the word ape .Unless you buying 
 GME 
 CLOV IS SHILL STOCK AKA 💩💩💩💩💩,
Way to go general!!,
I'm holding with you buddy! Millions or zero, these diamond hands are forever!,

\-angry chimp noises-,
#5 is pretty spot on,
You can hold GME shares without being a cultist lol. I find the turnaround story kind of endearing, and if people want to fucking buy gamestop, then it's a free market, no?,
ape flair incoming,
You’re spending way too much energy on this,
Your whole account is devoted to shilling against GME,
WSB is satire and for entertainment purposes. Created as an escape from all the snobby boomers that usually discuss the market. 

No one is forcing you to stay here. Plenty of other subs like /r/investing if you want to get away from the apes. 

Don't bitch and moan because you want fine dining but insist on eating at Wendy's.,
I joined WSB to see what it’s like.  Its celebrating your crazy losses and showing your big gains. Wish we had this years ago when I bought Nortel lol.  Plus it shows people who have the balls to go all in on stupid and smart moves.  It’s entertainment dude   Glad to be part of the community.  Wish I was younger to post crazy gambles,
There's no pump being timed. It's just a bunch people who:

1.	⁠Like a stock for a variety of reasons
2.	⁠Distrust most brokers
3.	⁠Believe their safest option is some sort of guarantee they own the shares they want.

CS helps fulfill this need.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I’m sorry you lost money shorting GME,
Sorry, was this wallstreetbets or crybabybullshit?  Jesus pick a stock or something…,
I think you should cry more about internet people doing no harm to you.,
Clearly some Baboon is upset he is not an Ape.,
you sound emotional...,
I don't think most of these people are doing it on purpose. They're just dumb,
The people complaining about the apes are nearly as bad as the apes themselves.,
Damn, here I was hoping I would have to go back further than a month to find your meltdown post about GME; guess I was wrong.

1. Some have tried and succeeded
2. Some have but others say don't risk more money than you're allowed to lose
3. Rarely see this but ok whatever you say
4. All over every sub you say? Could it also be bad actors on the "long" side trying to paint the GME longs as bad owners?
5. Ah right I forgot stocks only go up. My bad. Maybe you should look at the thesis to realize why the market would collapse in the first place due to over-leveraging and margin of hedge funds and market makers/banks.
6. I do recall there was at one time a hedge fund that called a restaurant that was across the street from a tech place nightly and when there were a lot of cars there overnight he bought calls. Some people have made dumb decisions and used drones. However, you can use them if you're licensed to do it in areas where it is permissible. There are rules and regulations for this. Point is moot.
7. Again see 6. This was also months back.
8. Ok? Do you know why the guillotine was invented during the French Revolution?

If you want to look at extremes I'm sure I can post a few youtube links of LOSS porn from wall street bets where people have lost tons of money. If you look at the extremes in any case you will see things jump out. I would bet that most have only invested what they're willing to lose and most are just fine with their medication.

Let's see if I can do the same:

1. a cult where you almost devoutly worship an electric car company.
2. Call people that go against the market because stocks only go up gay bears
3. Post loss porn for upvotes where you highlight how you lost your inheritance from your grandmother
4. Post win porn for upvotes where you brag that you made a good call where people say congrats and fuck you
5. Watch the chart and draw crayon lines over top of it to try and make sense of stock movement

I could go on but however close you look at something there will be cult like tendencies.

I love how Q is continuously tried for association on GME. I don't care who is investing in the company.

Edit:

Might I add that WSB is the only place where I've seen people invest most/all their networth in GME on margin in order to invest 200% of their netwoth for the $5 a month RH gold membership. I would also add that I've seen many on here trying to swing options and posting loss porn on options etc. for GME.

Yes, Robinhood that turned off the buy button.

But what do I know.,
TLDR,
They are just passionate bro. They going to be rich 🚀🚀🚀😎,
I don’t actually think it’s that serious believe it or not😃,
I believe in the moass, but the way people conduct themselves in other subs is super off putting. While I think there maybe truth to massive short positions on pennies and Amazon bust outs if anything it will result in a flash crash/correction.

I just buy (at a reasonable position size), hold, drs.,
I unfollowed one of those subs a while back because it was constant repetition of the same post, pictures and screencaps of DRS'd shares. What I find funny is one or two posts came up regarding that, and suddenly it was a flood like some kind of 'Cheat code' to beat the system.

How much money has Computershare made because of that?  I had to call my broker about an issue with my TFSA account, and he mentioned getting about 30 calls a day about it, and the cost from Compushare being about $400 a person to transfer.

Anyway, GME is the most productive stock I've had this year, It bought me a car, and a brand new Hilti tool set.,
I'll agree that the drones and tracking planes is a bit creepy. However, you do sound like you have a shitload of puts expiring worthless.,
I just want to know who is going to pay me more to shill their side,
all those things sound super fun and you sound super butthurt.,
The dumbest take ive ever seen is that gme is a hedge against a market downturn. Who the fuck is that retarded?,
[deleted],
you're 100% correct my man

they also want the economy to crash not realizing their riches would go with it lmao "my money won't be worthless, just *your money*,
I pretty much agree 100%. I used to believe most everything said, but as time has gone on, it’s something new every week.,
This kind of reminds me of the time I posted something negative about anti-vaxxers in r/conspiracy.,
Sounds like a gay bear shorted who shorted GME,
Yeah....but it's entertaining and some of us are just eating popcorn while watching the world burn because we're just that tired of the psychopaths AND the sycophants.,
This is actually hilarious how all butthurt apes commenting here that OP is butthurt when he just put yall in your place. This is 100% a cult of people who don’t know anything about how market works because they never even invested prior to 2021 and their entire knowledge base is reddit conspiracy theory posts. And when you contradict them, they get hella angry like this comment section. Literally same thing as antivaxxers or flatearthers on facebook. Refusing to listen to other side and mumbling about DD cause they think they outsmarted everyone.. just sad,
The crazy part is when I'm reading a different sub that has nothing to do with investing whatsoever all of a sudden a random ape appears to throw down a conspiracy theory somehow tied to it. Happens fairly often. lf You like the stock fine just the fuck up about it for a change,
##8 seems like a pretty hard false to me. This screams fud.

Edit. Space to not be bold.,
Apes are fake and gay,
6 & 7 felt like a stretch. Not saying you’ve never seen it but to say it’s a regular thing? I don’t even know what you’re talking about,
Apes are literally the stupidest mother fuckers ever. WSB was unreadable for like 2-3 months after GME because the entire sub was flooded with retarded DD talking about how it was going to hit 100 quintillion dollars written by devolved millennials resentful about being NEETs who yo"l"o'd their stimmy checks on a meme stock. Any negative comment would be downvoted to hell and anything not joining the circle jerk was buried. I hope GME goes back to 5$ so the mass of apes will rope.,
Number 5 is interesting as hell to me because sometimes I’ll see a bearish/market is crashing type post and click on the OP username and the fucker will literally reside on superstink like okay I see what you’re up to guy 🤨,
Agreed 100%. Like I got this new account and abandoned my old wsb account after my friends joined wsb during the GME surge and the god damn conversations about “hedgies” and “short ladder attacks” (spoiler: they don’t exist) are so fucking brain dead.,
Yeah the GME crowd is annoying.  Plenty of other ways to lose money. I made a bunch of money on it in January and the memes were good.  Now it's just sad.  You know some of those folks are playing with kids college funds or their retirement.  A bunch of people are gonna ruin their family finances which will cause families to fall apart.,
I'm in apegreement up until and including #5.. After that wtf .. if you need filler I prefer mashed bananas.,
Is 6 and 7 real?  
Seems like satire to me,
After reading this OP I just want to barf down my pants....disingenuous at best.,
It’s easy, just ban all the no flaired scum

Seriously though fuck you apes you ruined everything,
You read the sub’s tagline, right? What the fuck were you expecting?,
reminder that if it doesn't pay a dividend, it's a ponzi scheme (even the original wsb memes like amd and tsla aren't exempt).,
You come to the ape lair to complain about ape life….bad llama!,
Or how most are unvaxed then cry about a COVID market,
So many words! 💎🙌🦍 I just like bananas man! Rolling thru Wendy’s making this order isn’t the way,
“I wonder what will happen”,
[removed],
GME holders…lol,
Give bridge trolls resources and a voice.   This is what you get.   We are all to blame honestly,
Rout 70% of orders trough NASDAQ. Make it fare for retail investors.,
I do what ever I want and I don't give a fuck!,
Damn OP, tell the whole world you paperhanded and lost money why don't you. C.Payne would call you something of a  BITCH. 

& Don't talk about my main bae Gme like that or we gon have problems 😉,
I doth think the lady protest too much,
My conspiracy is all this "Ape" stuff is helped being spread by foreign actors (Russia , China) trying to fuel discontent just like the QANON stuff.

Push this convince a whole lot of apes GME is their one way ticket to riches , and they will be millionaires. Then once this does not happen they will blame the system , lose faith in the system and institutions that govern the system, and want to burn it down and support radical candidates on the (right or left) that does this and cause just more general division in the USA and even other democracies,

Myth - this sell off is because of omicron. Reality - fed is tapering faster than expected and same is true for interest rates..   myth - stock market ran earlier on fundamentals only.. reality - fed ingested lot of (trillions) of dollars in economy which made their way to stock market. Now when tapering and interest rates are going to go high that money would be moving out as stock market is not that attractive at the current multiples..,
It’s just an excuse to dump the market back to normal levels. Wall Street needed this catalyst,
#im buying your wife a used dildo from WISH,
New variant, black friday data, cyber monday data, jobs report this week, opec meeting this week, tax loss selling, inflation fears, tapering amount, holiday low volume.

Tons of variables for red.,
Forgot to mention jpow comments today, they played a similar if not greater role in the selloff,
Omicron sounds like a mid-level Decepticon boss name.,
I think this is just the big boys dumping stock every time they have cover from a news story. It’s going to get worse, yes it will go back up and down a few times. The easy money is coming to an end.,
Sometimes sell offs are due and just take a not necessarily justifiable event to trigger it.,
Biontech/Pfizer expects protection from severe Omicron infections.,
I mean this in the least political way possible, but does seem like a way to push more vax out as much as possible given that the mandate was essentially thrown out/paused for private workers. That’s the only thing I could imagine.,
The moderna ceo said that so his company can create a new “elixer” that will combat Covid 3.0 unreal….big pharma has no shame,
Calls on the qqq and xlf,
It buys apple calls,
I agree - there are all sorts of flu 🤧 variants - I don’t see them flipping tables about that…..,
Probably gonna buy some Microsoft,
wtf? lol saying the ceo of the vaccine doesn't know what he is talking about..  great DD lol.

&#x200B;

oh wait a second this is wsb.

&#x200B;

please continue.,
I’m running low on dry powder at the moment, but today’s bb dip was too good to miss. Another couple shares in the kitty…,
Nothing because this is just the tip of the ice burg.,
Look at March 2020.  Markets plummeted, then bounced to ATHs. Everyone needs to stop being a pussy and just hold then buy the dip.,
wish apple would give me a buying opportunity,
His might not but NVAX’s will probably have some efficacy.,
Most everything you said is incorrect.,
Buy the dip in VW and Goldman 😊,
I ain't sold shit and still ain't selling shit. This whole sell off is bullshit if you believe it is an Omicron based sell off. However, if I thought its was a macro economic sell off I still wouldn't sell shit because I already have 90% of the portfolio prepared for this and did so back in September, if anything if we continue to slide then I'll take the opportunity to buy the names I like. The other 10% is in PYPL and MRVL calls.,
Lol you actually believe it’s about Covid,
Doubled down on COST,
The Fed yanked rates. That's why the market is tanking. Omicron is an excuse.,
Just got some December 2022 calls for PTRA 😍,
Looking to buy a little bit on the dips in green energy $FSLR for solar, $PLUG for hydrogen.,
Oh, was it a red day? Me and my AAPL calls didn't notice.,
Anyone from down under looking into TETRA Technologies, Inc.,
Good to hear people being logical here. The news loves to sell panic and fear and it’s going to keep happening every time there is any new variant. Fuck the media.,
The market is, and has been, frothy as hell.  We need small corrections to keep reality in check which hasn't been happening.  Omicron is a possible problem and it needs to be priced in.  Scientific data takes time and the market is about speculation.  If you expect the market to wait until after an event happens to price it in you're going to be much disappoint.

What happened yesterday is what should happen.  Same for the tapering news.  Inflation should have been priced in long ago and now we'll just have a bigger dump once shit approaches the fan even though we've been smelling the shit for months.,
All bs . They will make even more billions now . INOVIO will be the game changer . Watch this space .,
What sell off?  The only thing that really dipped on the Moderna comments was oil, and that dropped way harder on JPow's comments.  A 2% drop is in the range of normal volatility, and not a pandemic market crash.

&#x200B;

That being said, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about with Covid.  Influenza went from a nuisance to a killer because of a variant that caused young people's bodies to attack themselves, killing 50,000,000 people-most of them young and healthy.  Another variant took it back to a nuisance.,
Benefit from this vaccine?  I don't think so.,
🐻🌈 Let's go,
My roblox puts did well today,
Sold everything in the morning to buy some $UVXY. +17% later I sold to buy a few more $NVDA I had a few hours earlier, just before the bell. That ended up well for now.,

Would you be interested in buying my shit split into 7 pieces then?,
Listen newcoomer, "why isn't anyone talking" is a Twitter thing customarily pronounced with a heavy lisp. That type is not welcomed behind Wendy's. It's a more of a biker mixing up with a bodybuilder type of scene.,
Never been a Netflix fan. The market share of streaming is more fractured than ever with all the competitors in the market.,
Because Disney is a better buy right now.,
Split into what?,
>Why isn't anyone Talking about NFLX?

Because sex is done within the walls of your BF.,
Why will it split?,
VIAC owners talk about it in that they say why can’t we have a valuation like that waaaaaaaaaas,

Buy them if your conviction is resolute,
thinking about opening a position too.  in your research did you happen across anything mentioning discovery’s interest in nfl sunday tocket?  discovery is a dark horse candidate to land that package and it could bring MAJOR revenue.,
I am with you on Discovery, but I think it may take 12-24 months to come to fruition.

I think the stock will more than triple in the next 2 years.,
You made me read the entire shitpost .Im interested. will dig financial of DISCA now,
Yes, a red wedding,
Discovery was a Cable channel. WarnerMedia was movie theater productions, with HBO for Cable Subscription productions. Discovery depends on cable advertisements for their productions. HBO depends on number of continuous subscribers to finance more productions. WarnerMedia was depending on movie theater box office.  
  
Discovery is having a difficult time trying to set up another streaming content channel, especially for a subscription fee, still with commercials, and premium to not have commercials. Most of their lineup has become Fake/Reality drek. Right now there is Apple+, Disney+, AMC+, Starz+,HBO+, Showtime+, Epic+,HistoryChannel+, and so on, every cable channel now having a streaming on-demand channel for a subscription.    
  
WarnerMedia is depending on HBO and Discovery to provide the direction and method to transition from Cable to Streaming On-Demand subscription. Look at DISCA over the past year and somebody with a huge number of DISCA shares rode the 4chan-ANON Reddit, Inc. 'Meme Stonks' hypercrazy pumping all the way up to when the news was known in corporate that DISCA was going away, merger value converted over to whatever symbol Warner Media Discovery is (WMD?), and they dumped tens of millions of shares over a few days. The Classic Pump-and-Dump curve, almost exponential upward, pumping, then sudden short span drop, the dump. That was the Chairman of the Board of Discovery.,
only good thing on here besides appl.,
I would say look into the AT+T side of this deal.

I think AT+T share holders get shares when the split happens. I dont know how that factors into the valuation but it definitely not a zero sum effect - it must have an impact.

I think for every 3 shares of AT+T you hold you will be awarded 1 share of WBD or some variation like that. I seen what "they" were estimating months ago and decided to sell my at+t shares because it didn't seem worth it for 2 companies (warner and disc) that were depending on each other for revenue to merge. Seems like a bad business model.,
Why DiscA and Not DiscK?  DiscK is cheaper and the new company will have only one class of shares.,
I think you failed to add in HBO's debt from T. T paid around $80+ billion and the spinoff is to alleviate some of that debt.

Also by that standard VIAC and WarnerDiscovery are good picks.,

The prices weren’t any different,
Sorry everybody...  it was me.  I didn't buy anything this year.,
I CANT AFFORD LUXURIES WHEN MY FUCKING CARROTS ARE UP $.30 DUE TO INFLATION!

Seriously though, people won't have much disposable income when they have to spend more to live.,
No shit. There were no fucking deals.,
Probably because they started Black Friday sales in mid fucking October. Last time I checked Black Friday and Cyber Monday were two days of the year, not a month long sales event.

Also people are wising up that the “deals” for black friday sales events aren’t really all that good. Many times they mark the price way up to put it on a steeper discount, which looks attractive on paper but you can often do better in other sales events throughout the year. 

The best time to buy clothes and such is actually the first week in January, many stores actually discount things 75-85%. For instance every year I go to the Vans store the first week in January and load up on shoes. Last year I got 4 pair of vans each prices MSRP $100+ for less than $25 a pair. While every other store in the mall had similar 60-80% off sales. 

While the best time to buy electronics is the week after the super bowl, things like TVs, Entertainment centers, surround sound etc… will be on the steepest discounts of the year. Primarily because stores need to dump left over stock from last year, and returns that come back from Christmas. They use the super bowl week sales to do this, then whatever they don’t move, goes on absolutely insane discounts. I got an LG 70” TV last year for $550 the weekend after the super bowl. The only 70” TV that hit the $550 price level during Black Friday sales was a HiSense and those are a very low end brand.,
Amazon is turning into Wish (aside from it's own products). Everything is some copycat Chinese product. Black Friday is nothing like it was 5-10 years ago. Companies used to create crazy sales and have insane doorbusters for the consumers - now it's companies jacking up prices and selling shit for themselves with this expectation people will just randomly buy crap.

Some of the best deals this month were 2 weeks ago where companies accidentally offered Black Friday level prices which never returned.,
Between political divisiveness and covid, we probably experienced the greatest culling of friends and family in several lifetimes,
It’s already been said, but I didn’t see anything exceptionally well priced or special this year. And the one or two items I would’ve bought sold out before I could get to them.,
There was no amazing deals this year..Most shoppers ( yawn)..🤷‍♂️,
I'm an ecommerce seller and shit absolutely dropped off on all sites I sell on. I get so many emails from other websites advertising their bf and cm sales, and some even extended their sales, which to me means they're desperate and that people are tightening up their purses. Shipping, oil, heating, electricity, food, everything is fucking people rn.,
Sorry guys it was me.  I was too stoned and forgot to buy Xmas gifts last night,
Cyber-Monday is an artifact of the early days of dot-com -- before shipping and logistics systems had caught up to the idea of online shopping.  Back then, low prices encouraged people to shop early when retailers needed the extra time to process and ship orders.

Why would people be in any rush to buy holiday gifts online?  Shipping is fast and cheap these days and simple google searches shows that deals are marginal at best. 

There is little incentive for the shopper to shop early so why do it?,
I thought profits only go up? Maybe I missed something…,
So puts on all eCommerce in Q4 earnings ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
The prices were like 10% off to 20% nothing really outstanding at all. not worth the effort.,
I still have a lot of junk of previous years, I don't want anything new (except things I can't afford).,
The sales were a joke. A 5950x was on "sale" from $800 to $750.

What a joke

&#x200B;

Also, nobody bought anything because we're all broke (well, some of us anyway),
People finally wised up. Black Friday usually only have several items that are truly lowest priced ( just a couple of good items every year from some of the biggest retailers - but this year they have Zero item that i considered good deal). The rest are crap. Clothing is never the best price on Black Friday for the last 15 years (my observation window). Clothes best prices is early January when they actually need to clear out their stock for the next season.  
When people noticing their grocery bills goes up, that cut of meat is now 1.5x more expensive and they also want that new shiny iphone 13 pro they suddenly don't have that much extra money to spend on crap they don't need anymore. As far as computer, electronics and WFH stuffs go, whoever needed them already got them last year. This year it's probably about food and travel.,
Cuz all the BF/CM bargains were lame this year.,
Now do the growth of 2020 compared to 2019...,
Push the shortage and supply chain narrative for months, complain that people shopped early? Da fuq.,
I mean nothing is available, of course sales dropped. If things like Xbox Series X and PS5's for example were actually in stock, they would have sold an absolute fuck ton,
I bought exactly one deal and that was still $50 up from the absolute lowest price I've seen on a product. Other deals were products I didn't really need or shit that was barely on sale. I miss the good old days where I used to wake up early, fight the long lines at Walmart, buy shit I didn't need or gifts for other people, then come home and nap for 5 hours. 

Now "Black Friday" is an entire month-long event with deals that aren't really deals. The consumerist magic of Black Friday has been ruined with ever-greedy retailers trying to FOMO people into buying shit they don't need at prices that really aren't deals.,
Same deals ran all week. From Pre-Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.  Zoom out and check again.,
We fucking broke.,
I am tired of buying shit I don't need. Looks like people are starting to see that to.,
There were no sales, all full price bs.,
Black Friday sales are all online now so that makes sense,
1,4% is less I spend on toilet paper monthly lmao nothing to fear, still bullish asf lets goooooo!,
Best sales were in early November. Black Friday and cyber Monday were just run of the mill store promotional discounts. Nothing special. Best deal I came across was some hunting apparel for buy one get the second half off. Probably why overall sales are up and specific daily sales in comparison to last year are down.,
Black Friday sales up though. Omni channel retailers doing fine.,
Because of the lockdown, I bought every bullshits that I didn't need unders the sun. Some of them are still in their boxes. I almost bought a 4th TV yesterday when only 2 of us live in the same house.,
Yet almost all the discussion is about the Fed Chair talking about possibly ending asset purchases 2 weeks early.....wonder what tomorrow will bring smdh,
They tried to push everyone online with shxt sales at stores but the sales online sucked too. people are catching on, took the idiots long enough. WAS 599 NOW 399. Printed on the box? If its printed on the box it was never 599.,
No suprise, since black friday is a month long now,
That's because more people were in the stores flipping off covid this year. You can't compare this year to last year. This is actually extremely bullish with only a 1.4% drop,
AirPods about it,
I bought 80% of my Christmas gifts in October... Supply chain and all... And yeah look at these non sale prices.,

Futures up.,
Bro QQQ is the way to play the crack up boom. Nasdaq will be in a secular bubble we just need to close back above 16,000 and it’s off to 18,000 quickly,
Aka the stupidity tax,
Why voo instead of spy?,
Why trade VOO options when SPY options offer penny spreads? Giving alot away,
50 DTE? Hold that bitch for at LEAST 5 more days. Even if it’s a dead cat bounce this week you still should be able to break even.,
Thats actually a pretty smart play. I was expecting a day to expiry YOLO but this should print OP,
Who the fuck is loan you degens money. Like loaning someone who spends all day in the casino money, you know even if they make gains they are not paying you back they are just putting more money in the machines,
Down 10k here you’ll be fine,
Calls on a etf? Lolwut,
A yes debt =/= karma. How could we forget,
Omg I might break even I truly have no idea what I am doing,
Also please get me some up votes my plan is to live off the pizza provided from r/randomactsofpizza when this goes to 0,

Yet meanwhile the fucking dick from moderna is tanking the whole market.  SEC hearing when,
Omicron is so yesterday. Papa Powell is the RISK now.,
I still don’t understand why people listen to the advice of the very same people who make a shitload of money based off sicknesses,
Well the DR. that discovered it in SA says it’s also unlikely to cause severe illness in the unvaxxed as well.  I get that this is Reddit and it hates good news, but generally “more communicable equals less lethal” and looks like the big O following that trend.   COVID is endemic and eventually either due to exposure or vaccination it will essentially become like the flu.,
Better panic just to be safe,
This seems to be common knowledge in the outside world but you log into reddit/twitter and people are hiding under tables in gas masks.

We just need to shut down reddit/twitter and the world economy will x10.,
In All people,
Biontech>Moderna. CEO cares about science more than money. Thats what happens when you have a research scientist running a company,

What is unlikely... I mean it's unlikely to cause severe illness in unvaccinated people too, so did he really say anything? And what is defined as severe. I get severe headachs sometimes is that severe illness for covid? This is all so silly.,
ugur knows best! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Moderna says theirs isn’t that effective. Pfizer says vaccines for new variant out early 2022. If Pfizer’s was effective for omicron they wouldn’t be manufacturing a new vaccine for the new varient.

Both mrna vaccines work with the spike protein, and the new omicron variant has 30+ mutations in the spike protein,
I'm sure he's being totally honest and unbiased.,
Well, since it's a statistical fact that covid is generally unlikely to cause severe illness, it's a technically correct statement.,
This guy should stick to making kebab.... Much more his thing. Also has a lot of germsy bacteria and other microbes....,

You are fundamentally misunderstanding how options work. Just because there may be another trader who bought your options it doesn't mean that you won't be assigned if they don't want to exercise.

Assume there is another trader (rather than a market maker) who bought an option that you sold. Either:

1) The option is not ITM at expiry, and expires worthless

2) The option is ITM at expiry and the trader exercises the option at or before expiry. In this case, you much cover.

3) The option is ITM but trader never had any intention of exercising the option, so he sells the option.

In situation 1 you don't have to worry. In situation 2, you get assigned. But in situation 3, the trader selling the option he bought *doesn't close your position*. Someone else just holds the option you sold, which may be another trader or a market maker. The point being is that there is *always* another counter-party for the option you sold until you either buy your option back or the option is exercised, which means you have 100% assignment risk if your option expires ITM.,
FYI this sort of thing is more popular with r/thetagang than WSB. These guys are too busy yoloing SPY puts to worry about wheel strategies.,
Sell ATM as long as it's above your entry cost. Super quick turn around time, do shortest expiry and get them called away, do it again,
Sit down and let me tell you about the legend, u/1R0NYMAN,
sir, this is a casino

&#x200B;

you're looking for r/thetagang,
Here's the mechanics. If your option is in the money one penny, your shares may not get assigned, otherwise, a computer is going to exercise.,
selling SPY calls… you belong here,
the only time i play with spy is when the market is normal. waiiiit is that now too? im confused idk.,
Think I modeled it out once and for the timeframe I looked at at least it actually underperformed just owning SPY.,
This is impressively retarded. Holy Shit.,

Friggin Mrna ceo. Torpedoed us,
As far as I have read it won't cause severe illnesses in anyone...,
South Africa: It seems to be more transmissible but symptoms are not any more severe

Modern CEO: OMFG IT WILL KILL US ALL WE ALL FUK BUY MRNA!!!!,
The CEO Uğur Şahin is a scientist not a capitalist.,
Totally different to that, what the Moderna-CEO said yesterday. I trust Biontech. They don't look for their share-price, they look to help the mankind with vaccines for Covid and especially for cancer.,
It won’t in unvaccinated either,
This isn't propaganda, noooo.

&#x200B;

Wonder what they will offer me to take the vaccine now!?,
So far what I've learned from the internet is that this virus is pretty much everywhere but totally contained, and we should be happy it's contained because it will kill everyone or maybe not which is good because it's everywhere.,
Or anyone,

Their market cap is already huge, not going to push it that much.,
Wow. This was not priced in at all. This is a major surprise. Amazing work Cramer. 

No, the stock did not rise 10% to a new ATH of $90 when the molnupiravir data was announced back in late October, along with supply agreements with the US for a bill or so.

No, the stock did not fall when Pfizer announced superior data for their own COVID treatment Paxlovid. 

No, the stock did not fall further when MRK announced lower efficacy for molnupiravir. 

No, the stock did not fall again when Andrew Baum at Citi declared Merck will can their islatravir pipeline after a trial's enrollment was paused. 

No, the street isn't worried about Merck's reliance on Keytruda given they have loss-of-exclusivity starting in 2028, hence their acquisition spree, most lately being Acceleron.

None of this happened. Carry on.,
Just buy a call at 9.30 sell it before lunch.,
Trading on MRK seems confused, it might try to push $84 again, in line with longer trend. The rest of the price action seems "muddled" and unintelligible. (Not really, but just seems noisy rather than consistent with anticipation).,
Read that it Barely passed due to potential birth defects if taken during pregnancy,
yeah with a 2.5 BILLION FLOAT

Unless 100 billion is going to rush into this stock on one drug that PFE and others are about to release versions of, im out!

best of luck though,
Up 5% premarket!,
Merck pill is not that good...be cautious,
the pill is okay..slightly better than remdesivir,
I read somewhere it's already got authorization for use in Europe. But with a 10-13 vote and major reproductive concerns I don't think it's gonna see any significant price movement. Well see though. I've got a small position,
Short term spike maybe,
Anser got at the funding! These vaccine makers are bottom feeders in comparison,

Don’t worry Robbinhood will find the sell button for you,
That just means you haven’t bought enough yet,
Don’t worry, robbinghood will delete the buy button too when it takes off,
Get the hell out of Robbinghood.
Use Fidelity.


If not they’ll liquidate your ass to stay solvent 🚀

NFA,
DRS your shares. 

NFA.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
You’re an idiot for having these on Rh for so long. You literally don’t even own your shares. Fidelity to computershare. Goodluck,
OH THE SHORT FLOAT 🚀🚀🚀 GET RDY BOIS,
good catch.,
Trade>Buy>100>Market>Review>Submit,
don’t be surprised if robinhood force closes your position or some bullshit like that,
nice!!!!,
But it’s not red? I thought you’re only sposed to sell when it’s red?,
It’s right where you left it. On the moon you stupid ape. Don’t sell.,
They removed it on purpose ! HODL!,
Imagine finding the investment of your life and only tossing $1,750 at it. I’d be pissed.,
Whos ready for the moon!?

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
So uh GME back on the menu then?,
Same except I bought 1000 shares.,
Same!,
it’s inside your asshole i promise,
I have been told by retards, apes and autists to NOT use Robinhood.

And all of them eat crayons! Some even have video proof!

So....what will you do next, after found the sell button?,
The sell button is located under options, covered calls, 3 Dec 21 $510,
I hope you find it 👁,
That is just an iou,
But I hope you find the transfer button!,
“A brokerage firm has the right to ask a customer to increase the amount of capital they have in a margin account, (or) sell the investor’s securities if the broker feels their own funds are at risk”

All robinhood accounts are margin accounts, they can and will take your money,
Can't believe some people are comfortable with having $20,000 of their money in Robinhood...,
You need to wait during market hours...,
Don’t worry you won’t need a sell button at your broker. They will push it for you…..,
Booo Robinhood, boooo...... Booooo,
💎🙌,
This post is so dumb. You could have had over double that selling at the top. 🤡ass retard. Sell before GMEguts 150 again,
Boooorrrring,
Anyone that is saying you don’t own your shares on Robinhood is a fucking idiot. You realize you own your shares? You do realize the only problem people had with Robinhood is that the 🅱️ypto was not yours because you did not have a wallet that stored your keys. Do you have 🅱️ypto keys with shares? Answer that yourself gay boys. What was the other issue people have with Robinhood? “The user interface is too Arcady and is used to entice uneducated traders”. I like the p/l chart and watching my money move around each second plotted on a chart. Who wouldn’t like that wtf every other application is gay because they don’t utilize this. I hate doing math to figure shit out, just give it to me in pretty colors and large numbers. 

So wtf is most people actually bitching about? Because they lost all their money on GMC and are now forever butt hurt?,
You could’ve sold countless times at $400+,
[deleted],
LEGEND,
So is there a reason GME is popping up again recently? Did they announce something,
Someone needs veteran discount,
You need to uninstall the app and reinstall it after 15 days, it works.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
GameStop doing cell phones?,
You’re a real diamond hand 💎,
Yes SEC, this is the guy you’re looking for.,
Wow. Great average.,
Robinhood bout to find it for you,
Sheeeesh nice!,
Computer share computer share drs drs,
It pops up when you select that big green button that says TRADE,
Downvote for the RobinHood App,
Can I ask how much money you've made off the Greater Fool Theory here? Lots of very lucrative covered calls written on the way up, I hope?,
Yo you need to DRS these for sure.,
I'm honestly shocked anyone is still buying GME on Robbin Hood. like. Wtf did you learn nothing?,
Haaaha,
If you stay on robinhood, you might not be able to find the sell button when you need it most.,
If you’ve been selling far otm calls on your 100 shares this whole time you’ve outperformed absolutely everybody,
It's besides the buy button.,
This makes me hard,
Bro fuck Robinhood, DRS THOSE BAD BOYSSS,
Fuck I'm hungry! GME tendies would be nice right now!,
I'd sell and then re buy at the next dip and keep repeating the process. Done this with LCID, SAVA, and now GME.,
Push trade ya dingbat.,
Could’ve been +40,000,
Press the trade button... then sell,
I’m getting closer and closer to the sell button and every moronic useless tweet sent by Ryan Cohen makes that decision easier,
Don't worry robnhood will disable it for u,
Didn't they turn off the sell button or something? Well good because I'M NOT SELLING,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Holding GME on Robinghood is quite possibly the most retarded thing you could do. Did you not learn your lesson in January? Get a real fucking broker,
For the love of your shares get off Robinhood,
For christ sake average up bro,
Why don’t you find the transfer button instead,
This broker is bad karma,
There’s a sell button?,

My 33 cost average and 4000 shares starting to sting..

A  little bit,
At least you had the wherewithal to not do this while it was $25+ a share,
How much did the .69 influence this.,
I don’t know anyone who doesn’t at least own 1000 PLTR shares. Seriously my entire network has bought at least 20k in common.,
100% is all in you fucking retard!,
When did it become ok to post share positions on WSB?

I have lots of shares but I don’t post that shit here. 

🌈,
$18 by end of year,
Looks like he did a lot of Coke and Hookers back in the day.,
Truely retarded,
Sorry in advance!,
loss porn incoming…,
Great price to get in.,
Oh you gonna regret this one. Pltr is just a losing bet,
Rip.,
92,
Ouch, this gonna hurt,
F,
Nice,
I am considering selling at a loss before it becomes a long term capital (gain). Once I do, it'll probably go right to the fucking moon.,
I bet OP sold at 20.96 then re bought at 20.69  to make this screenshot lol,
Do yourself a favor & sell when it gets back up to $26-$27. Love PLTR but it’s been disappointing to hold to say the least,
Has this thing moved in like 12 months. It’s the same price it was last year,

Surly stocks would go up because more people staying at home ordering stuff again,
F,
unlucky,
It will go up but any negative news always causes a dip,
Yes greedy boi get burnt,
I did this back Jan 2020 lol 😂,
Haha I bought a few stocks “at the bottom” when market opened.

Then the real bottom came and smoked me lmao.,
you should have waited until after the annoucement,
🤣 of all times to YOLO,
I don't like the font,
Lmfao bro what app or whatever you using to do options? Asking for a fellow AU share-buying ape.,

Too far of a drive to get to the roulette wheel?,
I’m confused. I might be a bisexual bull or a bisexual bear. Can’t decide. J Powell my therapist says I’m just in a transitory phase which might be permanent.,
Yeah, ima need to see the 1 year on this lil fella,
My charts look similar today.  I'm selling them as they go up. I'm buying calls after the 4th, hopefully the 4th will be with me.,
OP loses 89% of the time. Gets rock hard from his 1-2 gains per year.,
Gay Bear !!!!!,
I have a plan for you autists so listen up if you wanna hit big on Spy. Starting last week I went overboard with Spy calls (ITM, OTM ATM you name it) and then Powell makes a speech which sent the stock tanking making me lose about 1k. Yesterday, same fucking story. Went crazy and bought calls like I can afford to lose it all and what happened ? Spy tanked today. ITS MY FAULT SPY TANKED. 

So next time I buy spy calls, you buy puts!!! Together we will take over the market with a strategy like no other!,
I can’t do math that quick.. how much u make,

I thought the government had told them they had to pay the debt no matter what so bankruptcy wouldn't work?,
Why would you want those? Who knows what will happen?,
*autism intensifies*,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
It's actually entire Chinese property market collapsing starting with Evergrande, Fantasia, Kaisa etc It will take down Tether therefore Bitcoin, HSBC, London property market, Ashmore, Blackrock etc.  
This bankruptcy process is so prolonged and unclear to try to do it without crashing the whole...thing.,
Schrödinger's bankruptcy.,
China is fuk,
The chinese gov. is probably going to intervene soon if not already, evergrande going down completely will harm the real estate market in china and be really really bad.,
That child was the worst in that movie.,
I just want my Chinese puts to go through :(,
Love that scene.,
[deleted],
Well I think the general Chinese market is reflecting Evergrande’s ongoing bankruptcy adventures. However I don’t see it Impact the rest of the world in any way, unless big American banks sold Evergrande bonds together with A rated bonds to institutions and whatnot - that might be a problem if China lets Evergrande fall.,
I wonder if my bags of Xiaomi will suffer more from this, any clue?,
Why can't you just file for bankruptcy \*\*\*,
Also Mr. Beast,
It needs to happen, the situation has drug on way too long,
me and my YANG shares are waiting too,
I don't think it works like that in China,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
If anyone is actually interested in what is more likely to happen, read this: https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/communist-party-china-evergrande-housing-economic-crisis,

It was the same shit with inflation, it was important one day, sell everything, literally the next day had no relevance at all, buy everything,
Algos trade based on given rules but smarter ones follow other algos and market moves… this can easily turn into a positive feedback loop and then you have market spikes.

r/thetagang probably loves this as IV was shit lately,
🤡 market in a 🤡 world,
Cnbc sells stories, they must tell some storie. Imagine Cnbc headline: normal volatility in the market today, nothing to add, here a very good cake recipe. Lol 

They have to look smart,
It’s just a big fucking casino!,
High volatility and overreactions are a sign of lacking confidence in the markets. The hotter a market gets, the more investors are becoming increasingly nervous. This directly transfers into market swings on any type of news. Is this the black swan? Is THIS it now? Or THIS?,
It's algo trading as soon as news is released they sell or buy  the real question is who knew 7 days before the news was released and made bank the new variant was discovered Nov 11th.,
Market is looking for any stupid excuse to sell right now.,
It's a simple tax loss harvesting eoy couple with few whales selling like Satya Nandella to avoid higher taxes next year, go to Winchester, have a Pinta and wait for this to blow over.,
I am a firm believer of the Santa rally in December,
Moderna CEO came out an admitted he thought his vaccine was less effective with ZERO data provided.

There is a reason Pfizer said 2 weeks to provide an answer. SEC went after Elon for far less than this shit.,
Buy the dips sell rips,
The way I see it is this time around we already know what potential impact a strong virus can have on the market as opposed to February 2020. The market in no way will respond to Omicron the same as it did to COVID because now we have people selling on rumors and not the real deal in hopes to prevent that loss from happening again. You can expect the market to be very sensitive to news these coming weeks.

Edit: I personally would stay as liquid as possible and not yolo my portfolio on calls because trust me, there ARE better times for that.,
I mean, what does the market know ? 


https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/what-does-the-market-know.pdf,
Yeah I agree it is totally.bullshit... but a good buying opp.
Everyone knows lockdowns are a no go. Not only that but we have vaccines, treatments and even a fucking pill now. 
Lastly, the more mutations a virus has... generally the less deadly it becomes... although it does become more contagious. So why the massive swings?

Maybe all this jawboning is a way to keep oil down...
Maybe it is algos just over reacting... while hedges and MM's get the best deal they can for a Santa rally.

I don't.fucking know... but I do know we have to live with Covid.

Buy these dips... They're a gift!,
The bipolar shit is a combo of bad or scalping algos and retard retail like us.,
The Omicron Variant is giving the Fed cover to yank interest rates. “It’s not me, it’s Covid” JPowell can say.

The timing (announced on Black Friday) is the tell.

Hold cash & buy into your top conviction stocks,
You are wrong. They have priced in the next variant .,
It damn near felt planned. The timing of it was almost too perfect in conjunction with economic recovery growth, an imminent rate hike, etc etc. Whomever "they" are, "they" seem like they're using this to keep the market in-check, while also making other issues (inflation, gas, supply chain) seem not-so-bad.,
The sell-off is because Moderna’s chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel predicted that current vaccines would be less effective against the new omicron variant of COVID.,
ride the wave and profit,
The market is always volatile in downturns. There is a long list why the market could drop XX% but noone can tell you exactly when. Most likely scenario is always that the market goes right back up when fears subside.,
The guy printing dollars by buying up debt, is the same guy owing those debts by buying up stocks, is the same guy who owns your information bubble. You really think its mostly people responding in these threads?,
Some bastard loaded up calls when we were about to go green,
They want us out and have plenty of money to do so,
Isn’t it that jpow is hinting at an early interest rate rise? This would be a solid reason to sell if you have decent gains,
Fed is going to raise rates in the face of a new covid variant.  Because making it harder for companies to borrow is going to stop them from raising prices in the midst of massive labor unrest,
It's easy. Fed wants both a strong dollar to stave off inflation and maintain the biggest bubble in human history so we don't have a great depression redux. But the problem is that you can't have both. The bubble DEMAND a shit ton of dollar to sustain itself. Obviously stagflation is better than depression. So once the bubble starts to disintegrate, expect fed to reverse all their bs and sacrifice dollar to save the bubble.,
China property market collapse is accelerating. That's the biggest thing happening atm Evergrande is selling off everything they have for a fraction of its value to pay *interest* on their liabilities, not the principal. The demand for houses collapsed and their business is defunct. It's a liquidation without a formal bankruptcy because they are desperately buying some time for the big banks and the government to find a way to unwind the situation but missed multiple payments already. It's just a matter of days or weeks until the formal bankruptcy procedures will start. Their crazy bubble of 70 annual salaries to buy a property has popped. A drunk society was woken up with a brief moment of sobriety and looked at it. No matter what regulations or how aggressive lending will start the bubble was too ridiculously inflated to pick up again from its current limbo.,
Times like these I miss the good ole Trump tweets.

&#x200B;

They made things so much more exciting.,
The fed taper will have a significant bearish effect, and the fact that J Pow said he wants to accelerate it today will make it even more so.,
Scare me once with the delta variant, shame on you. Scare me twice with the omicron variant, shame on me.,
I think it is war on the horizon and big money knows it. Going to start with Russia and Ukraine. And then move to China and Taiwan.,
> The major indexes moving up and down 1-2 percent a day is not healthy.

They used to do that at 3% regularly,
I’m bi, just not directional.,
Cyber Monday sales were down by 1.4% from last year. Economy slowing, but easier to blame it on the variant. Fed well use the variant as cover, but that sales miss was no Bueno.,
You had me at “butt fuck”,
Calls and puts and calls and puts?,
Tax sell off could also be a contributor as it is the end of the year. There are always multiple reasons and a ‘variant’ scare provides cover,
not smart enough to tell you why, but smart enough to tell you why not?,
Maybe look over monthly to see what is happening to the indices. You are bound to have a pull back for the next month or two before heading back up. We haven't had a correction since March 2020 do you all expect the market to keep going up? There is bound to have some investors taking profit. This is that time now. Don't be surprise by it.,
IMHO this happens almost EVERY year at this time.  Funds need to pay dividends, the rich need to take their RMDs, losses are sold to realize tax advantages... The talking heads have little to do with it.,
Checkout the options chains for the next two monthly OPEX cycles (Dec 17, Jan 21).

We were at a tipping point regarding derivatives. Things looked bullish (option unwind to be supportive - i.e. lots of OTM Puts), but the variant news on Friday tipped the market over just enough. Now we might ride these PUT option down.

We shall see. If we bounce up the process will reverse, but its not looking great imo.,
They always have an excuse to rug pull liquidity

It’s part of the you’ll own nothing and be happy

How else can that happen unless Davos and their mind numb minions destroy economies

We are all commies now,
Holiday sales 🤷,
I read bullish, bought calls,
Some of us have seen this coming. I even called out Black Friday specifically in the past as the point of change.  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qg1ddx/get_ready_for_the_crash/hi4jy76/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3,
MMMs Market Maker Movements (something like that) which are banks and marketmakers moving capital to cover options hedging, on top of controlled sentiment in media to explain away the movement.,
The rich sell heavy taking profits, then the DONT sell or buy allowing retail to drive price back up, then they sell again getting more profits. Same thing Elon did to Tesla shares. He sold, waited for it to get over 1100 again, then sold more. Retail thinking they are getting a deal but really just getting f'ed.,
It means everyone knows a correction is due and wants to slip out of the party early. But when it doesn't happen they keep coming back to the party. Sooner or later though there will be a panic heading out the doors.,
My guess is the trend is moving capital from crap stocks to big tech. After all the new players entered during the gme meme era, institutions have been offloading wish and baba to these noobs and putting the money into aapl and msft. They disguise this movement through these market ups and downs. They'll crash it one day, then buy it up the next day, but the net effect after all the transactions is memes down, noobs keep loading up more bags, big tech up.,
Guess what? There’s always gonna be another variant.,
Let's not also forget today was the last day of the month. Lots of bullshit moves for clean reporting.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) US weekly jobs 20kish less jobless people than initially forecasted. Get on the green rocket today.,
Because everything about this has to be balanced out and ran perfectly, that's why you see even the shills show up here and this sub became a counter measure to be balanced out too.  The entire point of this whole thing is to move onto the crypt-0-dollar and off the petro dollar, to switch off LIBOR and onto SOFR (again, which is how most crypt currencies use staking and collateral).  

You can fight anything I say with parroting talking heads, but the facts are facts. We're all being ran through the greatest financial scam to ever take place and it's because they think (and probably will accomplish) they can keep balancing things back with whatever carrot or whip they use on the economy.  We're all being played by the largest Ponzi scheme of all time.,

then… when you are down so much on shares that it hurts…

that’s when you buy calls,
Hang seng up 4% in the last 5 years 😂,
If spy ends the week below 450 I lose $370k. Just wanted to brag about my retardation,
Entire wsb is bearish. You know what that means...,
Apparently, looking at what happened overnight, other countries are far more concerned about the new COVID variant.  We build it up and they knock it back down when we go to bed.,
I held weeklies overnight. Can't wait to see them get decimated .001 seconds after open. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Powell: “some of these lazy fucks STILL refuse to work”,
JPow: People aren’t willing to go back to their shit jobs. I am as puzzled as you are. I am completely decoupled from reality.,
Well it was fun for how long it lasted. 

See y’all at Wendy’s,
Down 50k this month. Nice,
amazing how i can lose money every day for 3 weeks straight. its almost impressive.,
Picked up $12k in spy calls. Only down…54% so far. What an amazing day. It could be worse. I could be down 69%.,
Truly amazing how a witch Iike Elizabeth Holmes can keep manipulating people. Yesterday she was crying on the stand claiming she was sexually assaulted.  It's all a part of her defense's plan to sow doubt that she wasn't in the right state of mind and that she didn't have true intent to defraud.  Give me a break. She is a modern day snakeoil salesperson, simple as that. There's no crying in baseball.,
I'm glad I have therapy on Friday. But I am afraid she won't understand yoloing on 0dte SPY calls.....,
Fuck. Going back to bed.,
THATS FUCKING IT.  AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT,
Hold on everyone, just got off the phone with Jpow.

Yellen tried to print out a picture of her canary.. jammed the bitch up a bit. Give it a couple hours and the printer will be back in business,
Just woke up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
I don’t even wanna look at this market anymore. Shits retarded lately just guided by the media spewing fear over variants that aren’t even bad. This is going to be the same cycle for legit years,
So who else sold Friday, fomo-ed back in yesterday, and is about to sell again today?

Sell low, buy high. Works every time 😉,
If Covid is the fear why are “Covid stocks” also going down? I have a hard time believing this is all due to Covid.,
SPY can't go lower here because there's no more room on the chart. Only way it can go is up.,
#BREAKING NEWS

Apple to announce a new color iPhone, ‘Shrek Green’ this December said Tim Apple in a press statement this evening.,
$SPY what the fuck. It’s up when I go to sleep and when I wake up it’s bent over like a college freshmen.,
Hear me out on this. 

I saw this documentary recently where a guy named Loki was behind all these variants. 

Can’t we just arrest this Loki dude and be done with the variants?,

All my 🅱️ulls load up on this fake dip?,
I can only average down on SPY calls until I run out of money. I have no plan after that.,

Hot damn, I'm set for life on capital loss claims!

🤑 It's basically free money! 🤑,
JPOW literally gaslighting the markets

 “I didn’t say transitory to mean short lived. Not my fault that you misinterpreted. Also let’s wrap up tapering: you do remember me saying that we were raising interest rates sooner right?”,
My tax bill has been reduced SIGNIFICANTLY since Friday,

I don’t mean to get sentimental, but after months of engaging with this community and diving into the rich culture we all have here, I just wanted to say fuck each and everyone one of you you all fucking suck.,
Shit dang. I’m buying this dip duh,
MRNA down 3.7% in Europe. CEO tanked his own stock.,
lol I really thought I caught $DIS at the bottom.. should have waited one more week.,
Nvda green,

JPow: inflation hot, not a problem. Supply chains suck, not a problem

Yellen: kids will be taken care of, bitches need to get back to work

Brrrrrrrrrrr,
The hardest part about 2 weeks to flatten the curve is always the first 2 years. But, I’ve unplugged the printer and I’m plugging it back in. We AIGHT.

They don't need to speed up tapering.  Student loans turn back on in January.  Adding 500 to 1000 bucks to the monthly budget of a third of working age adults will crush inflation and the economy,,

I love this game. I buy calls, we go down. I buy puts, we go up.,

Small caps have been warning us for a while; breadth of the market has become extremely narrow the past 4 weeks with roughly 10-20 mega/big caps carrying the entire market (SPY/QQQ).

I think we need to see a final flush on small caps that get bought in bigger volume than the downward leg.

Look for that for a real buyable bottom here.  Mega/big caps are going to get jerked up/down but should hold up a lot better than small caps.,
What if this is the single greatest bear trap in history,
Jpow speaking boys. Buy calls during his speach,

great opportunity to gamble/win big here if we stay above 50 ema into close. take out loan from the bank, 2nd and 3rd mortgages on house, sell wife, kids, dog, and go all in on spy 1dte's <30 seconds to close. good chance you could win and be rich, maybe slightly smaller chance you get rekt and have to commit sewer side,
I'm forever an optimist, and hate selling for losses, but I cut ties with UBER and SNAP today for sizable losses. They lose when everything is winning, they lose win everything is losing. Gtfo my line off vision. My portfolio is hitting the fan.,

My biggest issue is I always assume the market will buy up things that dip a lot

When I decided to buy the dip today I could have bought QQQ or apple, but I went “well I guess I’ll buy abnb it’s down 4%” then everything recovers but abnb 

Clown market,
Someone here got their calls wrecked Friday then went permabear and got washed out again yesterday, show yourself,
I'm not even gonna look both ways when I cross the streets.,
fucking jpow has one job to do: print money, and now he wants to stop doin it,
Not even -2% and half this sub is wiped clean lol,

Elon is kind of dramatic in these internal emails.,
While I believe in spacex long term, this is def bullish for rocketlab. I’m intrigued, my guy.,
Some interesting comments by Elon Musk on the status of SpaceX. The company is taking serious losses up front from Starlink and delays in production of engines for its super-heavy launch vehicle, Starship, are threatening profitability of Starlink by interfereing with the launch of a new model of Starlink satellite. Musk stated to employees that there could be a "genuine risk of bankruptcy" in the event engine production for Starship is unable to ramp up to where there is a "launch every two weeks" next year.  So what does this mean for us? A couple of important points.

[1.If SpaceX is truely facing a cash-crunch next year, it may very well go public to raise capital. Musk recently alluded to this in a reply to a twitter post about his promise not to take SpaceX public 8 years ago, he stated a couple days ago that "alot has changed in 8 years"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465389196613455877)

2. Even once SpaceX gets Starship up and running, it appears the bulk of its launch capacity will be dedicated to Starlink launches. This means that non-SpaceX customers may not be able to get space on a Starship launch even if they wanted to, ensuring that other companies like Rocket Lab and Astra will not be priced out of the market.  


Edit 1: I have a big long position in RKLB and a small position in ASTRA.,
Shit post. 1. Elon richest man in the world and 2. They can just go public and make billions in funding,
Or he’s just playing the game he’s a master at. 🙃🙃,
Lmao 


Rocket lab is like minor league baseball team compared to spacex.


It’s like saying “if GE goes bankrupt, my brother in law’s electrical shop will make it big”,
The likely reason behind the larger than needed sales of Tesla stock?,
Exactly why he should go public, we'd eat that shit up,
Did somebody say bankruptcy!??? How do i throw money into it!? Im all in!,
Or the whole industry is a speculative bubble with too much leverage. Capitalism does this a lot.,
If the richest man on the planet can’t do it then I’m sure the second richest man will. This is like Ford competing against Chevy.,
Dumbest shit I’ve read today. 

I do this for a living.
SpaceX rockets have several tons payload, and launch satellites worth x00M$ each for everyone in the planet (current leader in the industry, passed Airbus/ArianeGroup few years ago). The rocket landing moat is also practically unassailable, talking >5y development for a major player. In the spare time, they launch whole constellations.

$RKLB launches toy satellites, 100% of time one-off. The last few years have also shown there’s no growing demand for their launches. Simply because:
- you launch your prototype on $RKLB
- you launch the constellation with SpaceX/whoever with a serious rocket

Also, considering their Neutron development schedule, they’ll run out of money long before that’s ready. $RKLB valuation is full-on retarded, mostly thanks to signing their deal at peak SPAC retardation. I’d be a buyer at like $3.,
Lol. Elon loves his apes 🦍 🦧. That’s why he dumped a good chunk of his stocks and now he will crash stock so can scoop up the bottom in short future. I am not surprised by Elon, but by Apes that don’t understand his game.,
I'm sure things will go well with that kind of pressure.,
While I don’t think SpaceX will go bankrupt I do believe Rocket Lab to be 2nd only to SpaceX especially with the Neutron rocket.,
I offer 2% of my invention to whomever gets it into Elon musks hands. I call it the squid engine and it will render all other engines gay and pathetic. It turns atmospheric nitrogen into fuel through catalytic combustion and the byproducts are 100% recyclable and non toxic.,

Literally any other major chip company would've been a better pick. Lol.

Don't bother putting money into Intel yet. AMD isn't done spanking them.

Intel is going to become a good play, just not for a little while longer.,
Have you been talking stock tips from my grandma?,
Bought pretty long ago. I was up around 9k when it spike to $69.  

Truly believed they would be $75 but it just came crashing down. :(,
I mean, it is severely undervalued.... But will it do enough to go itm on those? Probably the 23, maybe the 22,
How about averaging into a few contracts at lower strikes with those expiration dates? Or, turning some of these into shares?

I'm bullish on Intel as they complete their domestic capacity buildup. We can't keep depending on TSM and other foreign chip makers going forward.,
Bruh that’s on you for believing in intel,
Lmao Jesus what makes you think it will go back to those levels,
LOL to anyone who buys intel. Either retarded or a boomer.,
One of the only stocks I’ve ever taken an early assignment on was Intel. Shit is almost impossible to swing trade options on because of the way it moves. Fuck Intel. On my DNT list along with VALE and PBR.,
I just bought 50c 12/3 right before close..

this is the way

to trade intel,
I feel this i keep averaging down but then in loses more money,
Your strikes are crazy.  I bought some Jan 2024 $50C and am running PMCC.  Working very well.  I will use all premium to buy shares and more Leaps.  I don't expect it to be at $70 by then.  If I can payoff the Leaps and have some shares left over it will be a win.

This is my low risk play even if the market takes a tumble,
im really curious how you got into intel, this entire place has been shitting on Intel for the past 6 months.  Did you try to inverse wsb??,
Are these calls for 22 And 23 year or is that the date?,
If you go against Red, you get red. Go Red, get green but, dont get THAT Green.,
Intel isn't a bad play, but that timeline was far too optimistic.  None of their potential catalysts are coming that soon.  You'd want Jan 2023 LEAPs at the earliest, but 2024 is much better.  If INTC keeps getting beat down, I'd try this one again mid-late 2022.,
The Jan 23s might still be okay, but fuck, what the hell were you thinking with those Jan 22s?,

Is he taking time off to focus on his beard?,
His decision to kill vine was brilliant. Anyone can see that text based posts are still the future. Video is just a fad.,
BREAKING NEWS: Jack Dorsey has just stepped down as Twitter CEO. He is going to be replaced by the current CTO.,
Lol, check again,
Probably gonna move to El Salvador and harvest volcano energy to design jpegs of monkeys or whatever.,
We've seen this story before,
For context if you aren't aware, when there is a rumor of a CEO resigning, the stock usually falls.,
He’s focusing more on Square, Twitter investors know this. By Dorsey stepping down…they’ll get some poor asshole to focus 100% on that loonie bin of a platform, instead of working on side projects.,
This makes me sad. Twitter will be such trash now. Full of Kardashians, Qanons and Face tweaked wannab- oh, wait.,
I wouldn’t be surprised if Ghislaine Maxwell is about to call him out.,
This might actually make the stock worth buying.,
To the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕,
Twitter is red right now. Always rushing with your memes heh?,
twitter: "dorsey to step down"

investors: "holy shit finally",
When Zuckerberg leaves, FB will moon.,
Spoiler alert: He's being replaced with a bigger fuck up.,
Next up, /u/jack to join /r/antiwork,
r/agedlikemilk,
🦀,
Annnnnd it's down.,
I want to be CEO. Even if you fail, you succeed.,
His replacement is an absolute steaming heap of human puss.,
And he’s being replaced by someone even worse.,
I'll say my pessimist conspiracy:  
  
MSFT CEO sold half his shares last week.  
  
Now Jack Dorsey stepping down as CEO this week.  
  
The world seems to be up in arms about Omicron.  
  
I compare this all to February 2020, 1.5 months before National Emergency declared in US for COVID. Disney CEO stepped down completely out of the blue. Every article about that stepping down of Bob Iger used the word "immediately". Far as I can tell, there was no planning of that specific time.  
  
r/stocks sucks ass and just wants happy news stories + happy spin. Anyone else want to conspiracy theorize with me ?,
Bye bish 👋,
the title 10/10,
He might be focusing on Square. 

That’s too bad he’s stepping down from Twitter. He created a platform and didn’t make monetization as much of a priority - compared to others.,
I don’t get why people see this as a good thing. He was actually the only semi sane one over in that hellhole,
He didn’t have enough big dick energy for tech. He had the autism, sure, plenty of that. But not the absolute peak masculine performances of mark zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. They clearly love the game of making money and they just kinda keep doing their game without giving a fuck,
Looooool fucking right there,
but have you seen that episode of rick and morty where the protagonist (rick) turns himself into a pickle?,
Good riddance. Maybe twitter will become less of a cess pool of toxicity.,
Did I miss something? As someone who doesn’t pay attention to Twitter. Do we not like Dorsey?,
Too busy molesting chillren to run a co,
This subreddit smells like badussy,
has a nest in his beard and wants to raise the lil birds without twitter so they can tweet without tweeting about it,
This screenshot was a minute after the news, the stock didn't jump because of him stepping down. It has crashed down because of it since, so complete opposite.,
He turned himself 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 INTO A FUCKING PICKLE 😂😂😂😂😭😭,
If this the funniest thing you’ve ever seen, your must live in a cave,
Lol except for the fact that this is fake: https://ibb.co/s9C9gw0

At no point since Jack announced his stepping down has the twitter stock been up by 7%,
“BUT THE PEOPLE ARE RETARDED” ~ Osho,
OP should invest in better hyperbole,
this shows you how silly is our economic system our financials are a joke, just keep printing papers and buying stonks,
This gives him a lot of time to take long scenic walks in the morning with a fresh cup of coffee, reflecting on our data,
Satan finally coming out from the shadows to run it?,
It was never up 7.14%. It's down. Normal investors have lost some confidence in the company.,
We all know we still wont be unnbanned for threatening to “light you on fire and give your ashes to a iguana” i will miss that account,
Guess they finally implemented the drug testing regime to include executives.,
he's not willing to go down with the ship...,
Wait until they see the new CEO resign over a racist tweet he sent out in 2010 LOL.  


https://twitter.com/paraga/status/28773976508,
This the funniest shit you seen?   You really need to get out more.,
Could you imagine how much Facebook would go up if that fucking alien stepped down?,
Jack uses twitter as a political weapon. Fuck’em,
Would be good to see him go.  He has done more than any other person to widen the divide between both sides of politics.,
Odd that Ghislaine Maxwells trial starts the same day that he steps down.,
New guy is even worse for the company... bwahahahahahahahah!,
Gislane Maxwell trial started today at noon. He's been to Epstein Island. Think there is a connection?? 😎,
I would like to know if it is 7,14% up because J.D. left or because the new C.E.O. nominated all white people everywhere his enemies and declared his first action is to supress any freedom of speech they may still have.,
Jack Dorsey is a cuck and loser. Ran Twitter like a toxic shithole for a decade. Twitter is bad for society. I hope it does.,
One of the worst humans on the planet being replaced by one of the worst humans on the planet.,
The stock will drop when it becomes known the new CEO is anti first amendment and wants to ramp up censorship.,
Imagine what would happen if Zucc stepped down,
Please tell me this isnt a step towards giving the cheetoh his account back.,
**"Why should I distinguish between white people and racists?'** Inflammatory 2010 tweet from new Indian-American CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal resurfaces as Jack Dorsey steps down and insists it was 'my decision' to quit

  
Dorsey, 45, announced on Twitter on Monday that he is stepping down as CEO of social media giant Twitter

  
He was the CEO of Twitter since it was first founded in 2006  
Dorsey will be replaced by current CTO Parag Agrawal

  
He was previously removed from his position for reportedly leaving work early  to enjoy other pursuits like yoga and fashion design

  
The move comes after a major bust up between Dorsey and Elliott Management, a hedge fund run by Paul Singer which has a substantial stake in Twitter  
It resulted in the hedge fund trying to replace him as CEO",
Investors approve, look at that daily gain lol,
really, funniest thing you have ever seen? you kids are so emo,
Dorsey is a communist,
Justice,
Well that's because he treats his employees better than most businesses. That means losing money for conservative boomer business folk.,

Hey /u/Round_Use1988, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
I didn’t read any of that I just wanted to see the comments,
that's a lot of words for saying ur 🌈 and 🧸,
" 'Well, I sold all my stocks today...'

You're going to have a long, hard investment lifetime."

\- Jack Bogle,
Actually stonks only go up,
Stock market already crashed.  The big tech stocks haven't, but everyone else already did.  One of my larger positions (a used car play) is back to where it was last december despite owning 4 more dealerships than last year and having 29% more revenue than last year and only trading at 6 PE.  It's like that with a ton of my positions, just bloody and beat to all hell.  Of of the despaced companies I own went fro 18 bucks a share to 4.50.    All on no new news.  the only ones left to correct are big cap tech.,
My thesis has several layers, but my brain has no wrinkles.,
OP's entry for today's retarded "if the crash happens tomorrow I'm next decade's new Michael bury" post ... Is accepted.,
"Nobody knows if the market will go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles.",
They said the stock market was gonna crash for the past 69 years. And for the next 420 years it’s still gonna go up,
Not until 2023.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Economists consistently predict 30 of the last 5 recessions,
The Fed's actions in March/April 2020 were decisive and huge.  They should have been done in November 2020.  The 2021 market is all the creation of the Fed and entirely unnecessary and ridiculous QE.  Tesla, GME, Cryptos, NFT's.  So many millenials think this is all different to before and they are beating the system.  All of the above would not have occurred to the same extent without an all encouraging Fed that always looks after its own.  The rich have got richer and the poor, poorer as they usually do, but in quicker fashion than any other time in history.

Don't get caught holding the bag, as retail always does.,
🌈🐻,
Buy some puts my man. I'm looking for a 🌈🐻 to pay my rent.,
I really don't know if it'll crash or not but I enjoyed reading it a lot OP. Always good to see what others are thinking rather than dismiss it.,
[deleted],
This is all cute stuff but what’s the trade?  Go ahead and show us your /NQ short position, if not you are just another asshole on the internet saying all time highs is too high.,
"market will crash but no I didn't buy puts coz I don't truly believe what I'm saying",
yep, market is going to crash, ppl been saying this for a year - and they are right.  in the meantime, take the tendies.  you may only have between a few months or decades before the next crash,
Buddy the market is proped up on buy backs from companies with loans from the FED. It is betting that with time stocks will go up, which they always do. It is just a matter of how long it will be until it consolidates into a handful of companies.,
Major shit ain’t gonna happen until the next 2-year and 10-year yield curve inversion. Until that happens, quit acting like the sky is falling. I see “crash” thrown around so often I don’t think anyone knows what it even means anymore.,
Positions or ban,
I have some puts for you! Sounds like you need them.,
Historical PE isn’t necessarily reliable to compare to. More people are in the markets and what was a normal average PE for any given sector or stock will trend higher as more people join the markets due to ease of trading. It’s free, you can even buy bits of shares. Etc etc. PE 30 is the new 20. 

Before the 80s and 90s, the markets barely moved. People who invested were reading quotes in papers and waiting for their value line analysis to arrive by, get this, snail mail. You called a broker and paid a $50 commission fee. Now you have kids buying $10 of MSFT on their smartphones.,
Sir, this is a crayon eating contest,
Nobody here can count to 9.,
So you’re a gay bear.  Nothing to be proud of.,
Normally I’d say whatever but Satya Nadella selling half of his MSFT shares has me a lil skeptical,
Nobody's reading this shit.....buy some puts and post that,
I’m dropping some friends off at the pool,
I was calling bullshit until I saw that you can't crop a picture. Now I think you're on to something. Buying SPY puts on margin in the morning.,
🌈🐻 r fukd,
is this cash gang ? you buying gold ? puts?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
it might crash. But it will be back to ATH by next week.,
Some stocks are over priced, but I see many at fair value considering the interest rates you get at the bank.  


Shares still paying 5% + divs consistently on top of capital returns.  If those shares go down, just means I'll have some cheap stocks to pick up.  


Possible crash = put some money aside for cash so you can reinvest it.,
This is interesting stuff. The inflation and PE ratio stuff has been the most baffling for me. I thought we would have a 15-25% correction with S&P 500 was at $410-420 but it clearly never happened. Maybe it’ll happen now or sometime next year.,
Convert to the Peso and boom youll still have millions after the crash,
Blah blah blah. Hold out for another 20 years please.,
Didn’t bother reading, but I am leaving this comment: Count back through history of all the downs including crashes, what we learn is the stock market will always make new highs! That’s a fact. Think about that for a moment and let that sink in.

There more millionaires minted after the pandemic shut down for those that stayed the course and pumped $$ into the market.  There’s more fortunes lost too for those who sold while the market dived and sat out for fear of doom and gloom.,
OP you’re sus af,
You know, with how bullish everyone in the comments is, I might actually have to believe this retard and the American economy might collapse entirely tomorrow or something...,
6 - please back up your claims why a 15% growth is not possible.  
7 - source on weaker consumer spending?  
8 - the privailing sentiment is that china will let evergrande collapse but bail out the biggest creditors like banks to reduce fallout.  


Also, the market is just shifting to be more reserved, we are at a crossroads here.,
chinese bots is my guess,
You know, the market will crash... Not because there's your prediction of it, but because even you (which everyone is judging as an idiot) already can see that there are no possible upside for now without some downside.

I mean, yeah, people will clown you for saying the market will crash... But now they just can't say why it won't crash - there are no good news ahead.

This is what will cause the 20% correction.,
You should never smoke up while writing thesis,
If everyone truly believes it's won't crash, the dream will become true and it won't crash ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
BB is the way to go.,
*panic sets in as OP makes valid points*

*spots typo*

*relief as it is well-known that the best arguments on the Internet are invalid as soon as there is a typo*,
There’s always one of these every quarter. One is bound to be right 😂,
OP put in some work only to get completely shit on.

Gotta love it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy),
All these hopium addicts and “stonks only go up” kids make me the gayest bear of them all. And I am okay with that. Usually greed is a big indicator something is afoot.,
If you keep doing every week, you will finally correct. Wait… is it today the day?,
Holy shit this guy time travels AND fucks,
Disagree with this. Money always ends up on the markets, that's what happens to loot. If the gvt are constantly printing more money, the markets will naturally rise.  Sure there will be blips of panic buying, but ultimately it'll end up on the markets.  Why?  Simple, if a billionaire sells his stocks they'll have vast sums of real money sat in their bank accounts and Mr Taxman will turn up and steal it.

This tax is taken once you sell your stock and realize gains.  It's fine for us lot with our sub 100k portfolio, but when you're dealing in the millions of dollars that tax bill can easily take years of investment off you.

As long as the money supply keeps rising, so too will overall prices of stocks.  Any fall is temporary and recovery is certain.,
Scary shit man,
Fuck that I'm gaining 10% a day on my portfolio. We bullish round here boiii let's go metaverse.,
people know that Powell will start printing again at first signs of trouble, they are not selling.,
I thought there would be a Santa rally running up to Xmas, closing off a brilliant 2021?,
When the crash happens, we do what we are trained to do. You BUY the F'n DIP!,
The OP is the perfect example of confirmation bias.   Your position in a shorting ETF will look like roadside kill with the SP500 goes to 5000.,
Futures have been crashing since this was posted. I’m all in,
Decent,
Tech bubble been the talking point since 2014. Good luck timing it,
Definitely agree. Been absolutely slaughtered in the last few months on my long-term Russell spec stocks… Even Disney has taken a 30% drop and Amazon is has been going sideways all year,
Serious question. 

If there is inflation and the markets are inflated already isn’t the scenario priced in ?

Like the stock which was supposed to be 300 is 400 because of book values which are obviously inflated in real life because of inflation,
-SARK (Inverse ARKK ETF) - shit I wish I knew this existed,
Whilst I feel you make valid points the only other thing really concerning me is large shareholders of biggest value companies are selling shares only and in decent volumes last couple of months. I appreciate there's tax etc to pay but seems a bit unusual?,
Good DD. Well today powell said he'll do a correction so you technically a step ahead,
15-20% drop are possible,
Excuse me while I inverse you because it doesn’t confirm my bias.,
Meh. If the market crashes, ya just make money faster.,
The market won't crash,
Behold, the smartest man in the room,
nice DD but the fed is literally bagholding like the rest of us. they're keeping pelosi's folio propped up. market literally cannot go tits up.,
[deleted],
The tapering is priced in.,
Im increasingly believing timing the market isn’t a thing. There is pure luck, there are a few blackjack players, who just know the game well enough to take advantage of small mathematical discrepancies, and then there’s the majority of people who are just stupid AND fucked.,
Dr. Burry, is that you?  Go back to 2008. You're not welcome here.,
Great analysis. Historically I’ve been very skeptical on crash predictions, but this one makes all the sense in the world. I do believe now we are in the middle of a crash, it’s just slow.,
Do not close your position, send it to me , so that I can pay less tax,
Weird. All these words but nowhere do I see stagflation or omicron. CEO of mRNA just said he thinks vaccines won’t work on this new variant. That means motherfucking increase in cases, shut borders, supply chain issues, in the face of  continue inflation . Once it’s clear that stagflation is a real 2022 reality, Tom lee and the yolo buy every dip crowd will be spit-roasted like the pigs they are.  That Tom lee will look better with an Apple in his mouth on the grille.,
>If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%).

Lol got that far before I stopped. You're a speshul breed of WSB retard, one who can't even use Google.,
Didn’t read any of that non sense since stocks only go up retard,
I want to see your possition in TZA.  I can't wait for the loss porn on that one.  That is the single most retarded bet I have seen on WSB in a while.  The first rule of investing is stocks only go up.,
I agree with you. Leverage is what's propping the markets up not bears turning into bulls.,
His or her thesis relies solely upon a twitter post showing a graph from 2011 when we were still in the midst of the great recession showing when QE was announced the stock market rallied.

Stock market is going keep rallying. Omnicron is good news for the stock market more QE!,
Every three month I get a good laugh. Don’t forget this simple acronym: S.O.G.U,
Printer go brrrrrrr,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
People will continue to call for crash until it happen. Every buy trade, there is a seller.  The author of rich dad poor dad called the crash in Oct, but now we are on last day of November.  All i know is, you like your stock buy and hodl.  If a stock is bad, u sell and get the fuck out.,
can’t time the market, play the levels,
Put your life savings on put options,
It may or may not I’ll always buy calls,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Win lose or draw it doesn't matter,
> Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.

Sure they can.,
RUT has been sideways most of the year.  It broke out to the upside and is still firmly within the channel.

I think the Market still has room to run.  The stocks that have taken hard hits have taken lots of the air from the bubble.   The real bubble is EV and everything associated with it.,
The market crashes on black swan events. Literally impossible to predict when it will happen. You may be able to predict what will cause a crash but the when is tricky. I think a war with China would actually be a crash event but predicting when or if that will occur is a waste of time. Better to diversify and hedge and keep riding the bull.,
“ If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%).”…you seem to not understand the difference between tapering and quantitative tightening.,
Sure thing Nostradamus,
Fuck it I’m in,
OP post proof of positions or ban,
Fed policy: They'll reverse course on a dime if the market starts to tank. J-P's got our backs.

Stocks under pressure: Because they think the fed will taper, this is just going to make the rally more intense when people realise this train has no stops.

Fed announced taper: my dude, they have our back - dont worry about taper. 

Valuation: The valuation makes sense when you consider that the fed won't taper.

&#x200B;

I got bored. Tl;dr the fed aint doing shit.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Well most of my stocks already crashed. So I guess you’re right. I don’t understand how indexes are at an all time high while all my stuff is down >50% this year,
Sweet! A sale!,
That's why I used all the cash reserves for buying a Nintendo switch and games for me and my litle brother... 

I might be young but im too old to be a scared bitch,
Already in the crash... for me on SDC ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Makes total sense.,
r/croppingishard,
Lost me at “there”,
OP instead of SPXU 3x inverse why not exponential inverse like $VXX and $UVXY

All my knowledge came from reading that twitter thread and I've no idea what I'm talking about.,

Show us proof that you sold your stocks or this post doesnt matter at all. If you dont believe what you are saying,
In other news weed stocks are a deal!,
If I got one NVDA stock for every bear monologue in the last 18 months….,
Imagine actually believing stocks can go down,
Fud,
Another nostradamus, you belong here idiot.,
I like the thought process of ARKK is down 50% so let’s (short/inverse) it now. Or that ARK is somehow indicative of the market as a whole and is lumped in with the Russell and SPY.,
Do you like HIBS for shorting the market?,
AMZN will likely go up....I'm looking at calls PTON as well. EZA is one that should fall a little harder because Winter/Summer tourism is big for South Africa and now all the Euro-snow birds won't come down.

This variant is ultimately stupid and just another fear porn tactic especially since the 'experts' are already saying that the symptons are mild, but if the markets are spooked, puts will be in order for a week or two.....then we climb again,
Nothing you said is new or original and shorting after a 40% drop across the market makes you just another sheep bear that watched the Big short and thought he could be special.,
Not another one of those who wants to buy the covid dip,
Nice post. I’ll make the “crash is just around the corner guys I swear post” tomorrow.,
I’m a bear. But, $130 billion per month via La QE injected into the market for years now. Most of your bullets are valid, but that doesn’t directly translate into a crash. If the fed pumped trillions of dollars into equities galore using QE, it’s hard to believe they want to set conditions to lose 50% of injected funds. Market is decoupled from our economy, and imo the economies decoupled from most peoples reality. In my experience it doesn’t pay to be bearish in a bull market.,
Well after it crashes, buy The Dip!,
The weekly crash is imminent post,
I remember when I was a 🌈🐻 
I lost -95% of my total account value after MY imminent market crash DD…it’s easier to be long my friend…. Trust me.,
Stocks already had a major correction of at least 30% on March 2020. I don’t see this happenening over a variant of Covid. Yes as usual people will panic, drugs & vaccines effectiveness will be tested, and comments from Fauci, Drug Reps will make stocks go up or down everyday. One thing for sure, it won’t be as bad as March 2020. Vaccines WILL offer some protection though how much not yet know. Most important part of the vaccines is their effectiveness to prevent DEATH & Hospitalization and that will take months to figure out with the new variant.

Coronaviruses don’t mutate as fast as Flu viruses so my guess here is current vaccinations will offer some protection.

Remember in stock market people make money if it goes up or down,  many people try to frighten others because it is for their convenience (think options put) so they can make money, especially people of power.,
I ain't reading all that. I'm happy for you tho. Or sorry that happened.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I do not compute logic

-Market,
There's not enough pictures I don't understand,
Blah blah blah,
How do you square your thesis with the possibility of JPow deciding to delay Fed actions, due to any economic slowdown?,
Haaaah GAAAY!,
Doesn't the crash happen months AFTER the taper?,
My portfolio crashed long time ago.,
Not only they don't charge their phone, they don't charge their laptop either!,
I can’t trust in anybody that uses Hotmail.,
This made me hard,
Lol at number 7. People already felt inflation on most essentials before this. Healthcare, school, childcare, rent etc.,
Is that you Peter Schiff?,
🌈 🐻,
I generally agree but we could still be six months out. Personally I've been holding SQQQ shares and leaps as a hedge and using energy stocks to earn dividends. After the mini crash and recovery last week I paired down my higher risk energy a bit. But if nothing happens in the next month will build that back up. No one knows when the bubble will pop....,
Who is this guy?,
🥱💤💤Tell me something new that I haven't heard past 5 years,
Fuck the ‘21 crash.  This goes to s&p 4900 January 

5500 June 

Your crash opportunity will def be in 2022 according to my krystal ballz,
Federal reserve will never taper.,
Stock market is crashing you were right,
Just chill man, market will not crash so soon. You are thinking too much, have a cup of tea.,
*their,
If omicron is very mild many people may not have symptoms or if it is similar to a cold markets could stabilize regardless of vaccine effectiveness.,
FUD,
You can also consider FAZ. But yeah, stonks only go up,
Gay bear,
Not reading. I refuse.,
i ain't reading all that 

i'm happy for u tho

or sorry that happened,
Oh look, another “the stock markets going to crash” post…,
Nice thesis tbh. Tomorrow is moon 🌚,
Booooo! 👎 I live in a bubble outside of your world,
Understood. Moving rest of portfolio into GME, for safe keeping!,
Internet kiddo,
Pretty sure this is all priced in 🤷🏽‍♂️📈,
The S&P 500 is within 5% of an ATH for over 90% of its existence. ATH means nothing,
No,
2023 is where we should see nice juicy bears entering,
I feel like point number 2 is kinda against it being likely for a crash if you have some sectors under pressure versus the entire market ripping,
Did you actually just use a twitter picture as your DD 🤡,
Another crush? Ok I’m buying,
Been holding 400 in cash for a while now. Pretty please I hope it crashes.,
When is the taper supposed to happen?,
Wolf!!!!,
You forgot about High yield bonds.,
🌈🐻 like![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Opposite of whatever you think, probably range bound for 6 months lol 425-470🤷🏻‍♀️,
Don’t trust this guy, he is a Mac user.,
china is gonna crash, AGAIN

u guys really eat whatever msm is feeding you.,
https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/11/30/powell-says-fed-will-discuss-speeding-up-bond-buying-taper-at-december-meeting.html should explain a lot to you all,
Crash is imminent. But you can never know exactly when. It can be December or 2025 for all we know,
Futures down 580 again as I type. BLOOD red lads.,
totally agree,
JuSt bUy ThE dIp!,
u/variation-seperate is that you?,
Also quarter end rebalancing, since bonds are attractive again.... Shit will get real.,
I hate to admit it but guy might be on to something.,
You think after all that has gone on since the start of COVID, that the fed will just stand by idly and continue to taper while watching the market crash? 

I don’t think you are wrong about most of your thesis but struggle to believe the fed would reverse course regarding tapering if the bottom appears to fall out.,
You keep thinking this. 

Tomorrow i am cashing out all my other stocks and all in on TQQQ. 

Wish me luck.,
Why no UVXY?,
Dude isnt there a wierd feature of these double/triple levered ETFs when they rebalance their portfolio it fucks with your gains? They advise you to not hold them for long periods iirc.

Good luck tho on calling the timing,

TME is up 2.7% today. Therefore tencent is even more of an investor safe haven than apple according to this article’s logic.,
Its a flight to safety, cash is trash in an inflationary environment so people shift to blue chip stocks with real assets and pricing power. When the rest of the markets rebalance the piggy bank is broken and then people buy again. Its a normal market cycle.,
Because of deez man...,
Apple trades flat or slightly up when spy drops. This isn't new.,
apple is working apple car and glasses for the meta/omniverse

tesla, nvidia, apple all have that in common - ai for self driving plus others and all 3 are green,
They have Kenny,
Apple January puts?,
Checking to see how much China is invested...Free Taiwan...,
They are the only winner in this black friday season,
It's probably a continuation to the interest in the company after Apple's EV rumor surfaced.,

Any profits you have in this market I would be taking.,
I’d sell 50-75% of it,
I’d sell 10 contracts and let the rest ride,
Rules of WSB Number 17:

> If it's good enough to take a screenshot then it's good enough to sell.

Go forth my child and please don't multiply.  Your genes probably aren't that good if you're in here.,
Never bad idea to collect profits.  Never look at what else you could of made. Look at what you cashed out on.  Always opportunity. I don’t think they will stop selling calls or puts anytime soon ;),
I’m holding the Feb 2024 140 call and debating, wish I had a couple to be able to take some profit, but it’s all or none,
If you want to post loss porn for us tomorrow...sure. Let it ride. 👍,
Alright I sold 8 and let 5 ride, I was just messing with yall. This shit can very well dip fat tomorrow.,
Sell 8 and let the 5 ride.,
Fuck yea,
I don't think it matters what anyone tells you lol you're just gonna do it anyway,
Nah , take all profit and look for another play,
If you ain’t losin money you ain’t doin it right,
I’d personally sell, but honestly if you cover and let the rest ride out it might be good for you,
Sure, you don't want to be the only person making money this week anyway.,
Cashed in all my aapl calls last night, gonna buy more next dip,
What's the rule? Good enough for a screen shot. Sell off what your stake is if you want too.,
Wait till +100% and sell half and let the rest ride. Or sell 10 now and let the rest ride if yrr scrrrd.  
  
  
edit: or sell all now if you're basic,

You're home son... You're home,
Probably a broke retard depending on the price of your options. But I feel this I'd partly due to more carona crap. So maybe it's not entirely your fault,
r/baba 📈,
If you truely believe in the company buy shares.,
Misery loves company, and I love you,
Lol I'm down that, but without options even. Imagina the tragedy of bagholding BABA!,
if you like china stock why not JD? they are outperforming BABA. CCP is obviously choosing winners and BABA is out of favor,
Buy some Feb. puts on Baba, soon as word breaks Ma is being held or dead,  the stocks going to tank.,
The CCP thanks you for sending over much needed foreign capital,
Dude, Paramount-Leader-For-Life disappeared the company's CEO.  Ho don't come back from a pimp slap like that,
🇨🇦,
Why not Tencent or Xiaomi? They're much less under the public radar.,
Good to know I am not alone,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Retard it is! God speed.,
If you have bought calls in a hot stock like Alibaba then you will probably go down as the former.,

For 33k with 3% profit that was not very gay of you,
$33k to make just $1k tf,
Go hibernate and never wake up 🏳️‍🌈🐻,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
Is this some sort of 🌈🐻 and theta gang porno crossover film?

What the hell is this? Risking $30k for this? Dude, you’ll be down if SPY lays the smallest fart and heads up.,
IV Crush incoming!!!,
This is nutty bro.  How you gonna buy puts on a smashing red day when IV is at an absolute relative premium???,
3% return on a 30k investment. You escaped by the skin of your teeth.,
Popped in the post to call out how retarded OP was, and I'm glad others beat me to it. 

30K to make 1K lmao. Best hope SPY keeps dropping because I don't think it will. 

If you had put that 30K on NVDA at open you'd easily cash out at market close at 20% or more.,
Buying puts THE DAY it drops > buying puts when this would actually be profitable 

Nice one!,
You could have just given me the 33k to lose for you free of charge,

you forgot their upcoming factory in poland.

Nio will do great going forward. XPEV too.,
I don’t know man. I’m a lover of NIO but I have a bad feeling about the deliveries…,
That’s one of the few Chinese stocks I am bullish on, and I am speaking as an ethnic Chinese,
Been hearing this for months fuck NIO & XPENG,
Let’s hope it moves soon. It’s massively underperformed compared to other ev stocks,
Stop investing in Chinese companies,
Lol.

Good luck,
Nio could announce 100millions of cars sale, unfortunatly this would not have any impact on the stock rise...,
Xpeng > Nio 

No facilities my ass, do your homework better,
But it is a China stock. I just have to look at BABA to see that what the company is doing, does not matter. As long as the Chinese property developers are at high risk of defaulting on their debts a lot of money is going to stay out of China stocks. 

I have tried playing Nio Catalysts in the past, it just does not work.,
Sleeping giant.,
I'd _put_ my money on it breaking downards. (haha get it??)   
  
For real though, I think RIVN was the icing on the cake that was the TSLA rally, and the market is now paying acute attention to the ridiculousness of current EV valuations. With everything else that's happening, and NIO being a lmao Chinese ADR, a hard downside break seems way more likely than any additional mooning.,
1989s Japanese auto invasion Chinese style.,

What's her name just bought 25 mil,
Buy it while Vlad is taking the opportunity to thank you to support his stock,
The best way to lose money is to speculate,
What do you expect the feedback will be here retard?,
I see still bunch of retards here still use RH including myself .

 Calls on HOOD,
Its on SALE! instead of buying contracts buy shares,
Don’t let these apes tell you “fuck RH, it’s trash” because of the GME debacle. However, look into their last earnings. I think there’s reason for the steep drop-off and I won’t be buying. They make money in euphoric/speculative markets and quite honestly it looks like it will be difficult for them to put out good earnings consistently,
I think so.  But Im not about to yolo it....,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I think its very undervalue for a long term play. A lot of people bash it cause of Gamestop debacle, however it has one of the user interface. RH will be force to innovate due all the new competitors entering. I think its deff a buy.,
It's a 5$ stock let it die,
YOLO 200 OTM calls. They can remove the sell  button  for their own ticker. To the moon.,
Where's the shitpost tag?,
Alright serious question is Kathy Wood really all that smart? Like she’s made great investments in the past, but does anyone think she was kind of a one hit wonder? With this recent HOOD investment, the ARK funds going to shit, makes me question things. Obviously she’ll know more about the markets than I ever will, but in the grand scheme of things she’s not doing terribly well this year.,
They don't have any more customers.,
Robinhood did a thing, but it’s still a simple brokerage and user friendly. It’s best to dabble with a few to cover more ground, but I would wait a little while longer on Hood. Nothing makes me believe it’ll pop,
Too late for calls is my guess. Would've been a great move.,
For sure,
No,

Asking for long term trading advice from crash and burn YOLO induced day/weeklies trading autists doesn’t seem like a smart idea…
Actually… welcome to the club you belong here.,
Intel is completely fucked, on the inside.  It will take years, if ever, for Pat to fix a culture that that took them from the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing to a distant 2nd (maybe 3rd).  Intel has an abnormally high number of H1B employees, even for tech, because people waiting for a green card priority date are the only people willing to stick around in a dead end company.,
Intel will follow the inevitable downtrend as IBM unfortunately.,
My main question with them is, how will they compete vs AMD and NVIDIA at this point? AMD's caught up to their market cap and will have the funding to most likely outpace Intel's development.   
The same goes for Intel's GPU vs Nvidia.   
I can see them staying in the game by undercutting prices, though.  
For a long-term bet, it seems to be relatively safe due to chip shortages, and maybe the new CEO can pull a hat trick.,
I’m long intel but the company is a dog, the only hope is government handouts for us chip production. It needs to really crater before the turnaround can happen, like ibm or Apple.,
"Intel" "underdog"...

AMD was an underdog, Intel is the market leader still... If you're going to buy one buy AMD they next time it dips to $145 they aren't done.

Nothing suggests that Intel is going to do anything but bleed value trying to catch up over the coming 5 years. It's proven itself to be a lump of aggressively arrogant turd and let it's monopoly of the CPU market turn it into a lazy firm that focusses on counting money, whilst AMD has flown under it and given the HPC market exactly what they want at a decent price. 

Intel would be bleeding out if the US govt hadn't subsidised their sorry assess.,
Intel might be one of the most grossly mismanaged empires of all time, squandered an astronomical lead(literally couldn’t go tits up) yet managed to go tits up. 

Intel is about to hit a brick wall in revenue growth, might be the GE of semiconductors. Been failing at organic innovation for a decade(modems, microcontrollers, fab problems, missed Mobile market completely). All their latest moves are too little too late. Put your money elsewhere, or don’t if your intention is to lose money.,
Lol. Watch Steve Jobs explain what happened to Kodak. Intel for more than a decade became nothing more than a collection of bean counters. They lost their edge with hunger and their tech. Of all the companies, why the hell would you put it in intel? There are so many better dividend earning plays out there. Me thinks you’re trolling,
Intel gets brought up every other week.  
The reason why it's so low it's because they are unlikely to post growth anytime soon and they mentioned more spending to increase competitiveness.  

More spending = risk of your dividend getting slashed.  

That said, Intel has a limited downside, this is pretty near rock bottom already in this market at these ratios so if you have nothing else to buy I don't see why not.,
Long term? IMO no, hell no. I bought calls a week back because I fully expect it to dead cat bounce as people, like you, try to prop this piece of shit up. Then I'll sell and watch INTC slide, probably for a couple years, until they get their shit together.,
Intel used their cash for stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in themselves for so many years,
Intel is not the underdog tho lol.  It's too big and old of a company, AMD was the underdog!,
Wrong place for advice but intel is a sideways company in general. In the last 5 years they are up 39%. Wow.,
Amd has 7 nanometre chips , AMD working on 5 nanometre chips released soon.

Intel is using 10 nanometres. Plans to get 7nm in 2 years.

Normal bench mark cpu (intel) is 64 cores 128 threads.

But amd is release next year 128 cores and 256 threads.,
Interesting thought that I've considered as well.,
No, they fell behind a long time ago and focused more time and money on attacking competitors rather than research and development.,
Chip demand should continue to grow, I would suspect any and all of the companies will grow with the demand. Some more than others.,
Intel has been saying they're going to compete in the GPU market for over 10 years and AMD has been taking some big stabs at them with Ryzen in the past few years. Personally I think Intel is going to take a bit of a dip before it takes off again but I think it will definitely bounce back eventually.,
It’ll be a while… they already broke ground on foundries in AZ… they won’t be operational till 2024 maybe,
I mean it’s a turn around play like f or ge…,
Sir r/investing is that way, you don't go to casino and ask advice from ppl with gambling addiction. 🙃,
Intel be permafukd,
A long-term "bet", YES

A long-term "investment", NO,
r/Stocks,

That’s my boi!,
Good, let's bring back the gme hype more, need more posts like this sir! God speed !!,
I certainly didn’t hear no bell.

Still round 1 bish!,
I’m with you bro with my shares!  LFG,
I hope you exercise those….,
Lesss get ittttt,
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie Gamebang,
Beautiful '22 calls. Bet they'll print in January,
Thank you for your donation,
Short interest showing 113%+ on finviz.com 🤯 you about to get paid son.,
Yesssssssssssss 🙏💯💯💯,
2022？？？my godish,
Can't stop won't stop what?  
Can't stop pressing the Buy button?,
Can't stop.. won't stop... Doorstop.,
does the - in the front mean you are short those calls?

i dont get what your position are by this random screen shot.,
Right on soldier,
you donguses check out the dd that explains this coming january yet?,
is that even a yolo or am i just old,
Please don't stop, the loss porn only gets better the more you do it.,
Ouch,
You guys are still doing this thing?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968) rip,
Man dicey....

Earnings coming soon.

Maybe too soon to buy up calls?

Hope it rips before then so you can exit before earnings?

I'm about to load up after earnings for Jan and Feb.,
Finally some good material. I haven’t beat my comically small wiener in fourteen minutes. Welp, time to go brush my wife’s boyfriend’s hair.,
That is such a yolo.... in 20 days, if it goes up to $250 u make 9k,
I can’t read, what’s the date on these?,
Shoulda bought shares though,
Well, we've got an army behind us, can't lose bruh! Price could drop too $50 and I ain't scared with all my homies in my corner! Shit, drop it to $50 and watch my come up.  Licking my damn lips on this $190 sale.,
Unless RC announces some good shit on ER this money is going straight into the belly of the beast.,
Why would you buy these,
#next stop, Wendy's dumpster,
Why no shares?,
What's your break even point, for these calls? I don't know why you would even pick up some of these.,
Better off putting it on black at a casino,
You'd probably be better off just buying 300 shares

Then at least the chances of your "investment" going to $0 isn't 100%,
epic.,
Those are some pretty Christmas colors,
you made my dick hard bro. the forbidden practice.,
You big dick bastard!! I’m cheering for you! 🦍💪,
Classic your most OTM call is the closest to expiration.,
So I've waited until GME dropped below $200.... don't let me down you crazy crayon eating bitches!,
Bud, roll those Jan calls to Feb. Not Financial Advice :),
This is why its going nowhere because idiots like this are spending $60k on only calls instead of stocks which help move the price. Not even helping themselves profit from their calls.,
Rough butthole there guy,

On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it -52.7k,
Lols, imagine in a portfolio full of calls, you get puts on AAPL, which is the only thing that rose today. Irony is a bitch aint it.,
At least you were smart enough to get DKNG after the superbowl.,

AAPL BA F good stocks. The rest is garbage long term. Good luck.,

Stop buying calls and don’t short Apple ever again they don’t play fair over there 
Today is a example of that 😂😂😂,
Love IBKR !,
You deserve to get fked in the ass,
I appreciate this post so much.

It makes me realize that i am not so dumb for selling a bunch of aapl shares at $164 today. I was feeling bad about missing out on $2 of after hours movements.

Now - after seeing the worst portfolio i can imagine.....no regerts.,
Down 52k Christ.,

Bought this stock back when it was $18 a share. Still holding now they pay a small dividend.,
That’s a name I haven’t heard in a long long tome,
Meta universe ?,
since these are calls. i feel i can share that i sold my micron shares for AMD.,
DDR5 goes brrrrrrrrrrr,
CEO & CTO speaking tomorrow. LFG,
Cant go down.,
ahh….old timer…,
I went in for 200 calls at 100 on 1/7.  Not exactly a yolo, I just feel that the memory and storage sector is really undervalued compared to other “chips.”,
Are you my boss at work?,

Uncle Ben:  "With great beard, comes great responsibility" \* dies \*,
He's really nailing that "local metal band that plays birthday parties" look,
You know you might've been a bad CEO when upon your resignation your cpmpanies stock goes up so much they halt trading.,
Sell the beard.,
He claims to be moving to Afghanistan, but in reality will be wintering in an undisclosed location in Pakistan.,
Going for the "applied to the LA school of arts to be in film but flunked out and now work as a barista at a Kombucha bar" look huh?

I do enjoy when the richest people look the most homeless though good for them must be nice to not have to care,
I figured it was to spend more time with his peyote,
Time has not been kind to Jack,
Jack, you look like a steamy pile of shit.,
Good, because that bears needs some fucking work,
Jihad beard,
beard like the male assistant who's really a boyfriend?,
You're a wizard Dorsey!,
Web dev tools can literally change reality.,
He wanted to be a Greatest Of All Time tech founder. Now has time to focus on being a goat,
Russel Brand default character.,
At least we know what his pubes look like.,
the antihero we needed. RIP.,
It does look in need of some trimming.,
Dude needs to shave. Seriously.,
Timing just coincidentally lines up with the Maxwell trial.. Dorsey will be the first of many to step down. 

Time will tell.,
twatter,
I thought that was Aaron Rodgers,
Almost had me,
And Twatter immediately jumped 7%,
He wants to achieve that "Wizard" look the one from that movie right now his high-level Magician.,
Just like that, Twitter went from crazy jump all the way back down,
[deleted],
Who is on his Beard of Directors nowadays?,
I hate this dude and Twitter. Dave Chappelle said it best
"fuck twitter it's not a real place",
Jack Dorsey to help high oil prices by washing his hair.,
TWTR market cap has grown almost 30% over the years from insiders selling and share price hasn't done shit.,
His beard is just a cover for his sexual attraction to minors,
Such a beta cuck lol,
Dude is a pedophile. Coincidence he resigns wile there's a court trial happening right now? Along with  few other? I wonder,
Fuk him let him die by cancer In the eyes. Earth will be better without scumbags like him.,
There's a certain trial going on right now involving the girlfriend of a guy who allegedly didn't kill himself.  I've seen some whispers around the interwebs that say Jackie Boy may be connected there in some way.  If that's too tin-foily for you then maybe he had an epiphany over Thanksgiving and decided to do something nice for the world and just go away.,
isnt he a pedo?,
Genius!,
Where's his beard?,
That boy didn't age well.,
New ceo will take this to moon 🌙,
Cosplay of bin laden is it?,
He's going to live in the meta verse,
Why does he always look grungy or sweaty,
He didn’t follow proto he’s done,
This is really well done. Looks authentic.,
Is he heading to the ‘stan,
Twitter is failing to gain new customers. I don’t think his resignation gonna change that. At least he can take care of his beard and move to El Salvador.,
Your beard is good,
Beard influencer on twitter > Running fucking twitter,
Guy who is replacing him is racists AF… hates whites.
Yay 2021 liberal racist America,
maybe twitter can unban everyone now,
I guess you can do that when you're a censoring activist billionaire,
Why did they put a picture of Aaron Rogers on the article?,
In other words, he said the n word when he was 6 and someone found out,
Deep state was done with him.  Nothing more.,

Buddy sends me a trade and tells me to buy PUTS I decided to YOLO it. Now off to buy a new car.,
You have a friend who told you to buy 50,000 dollars worth of Pfizer puts?,
I need new friends,
My buddy told me to buy Pltr…we’re no longer friends.,
nice, now do it again,
[deleted],
Why did PFE go down while MRNA is still mooning?,
U owe ur friend dinner at the least,
Calls tomorrow,
When did you open this?,
You both shorted Pfizer in the middle of a pandemic in which they have a leading vaccination and made bank.  
Fuck you. Fuck your buddy. Fuck Xi variant. I'm going to kick the dog.,
If you haven’t sold it and put the money in your bank account you haven’t made crap yet.,
Nice,
F U! I need friends like yours.,
What's a strangle? Like you just buy a put and another put at a different expiration date? Why not just buy 1 put?,
Is this an ad?,
But the thing is, did you sell it?,
You have friends? Why are you here?,
hope you sold,
Must have some real trust in this friend to risk that much. (Im scared money/poor) haha

Hope this helps bring you and yours a GREAT Christmas.

Cheers,
Can someone legit explain this?

And

Did he already have to own 200 shares?,
Pfizer puts?? Are you Nuts?? Pfizer announcement on Omicron vaccine incoming in 3...2...1.,
FUCK!,
I buy what my friends tell me, and since we're good friends, they tip me extra when they come to the car wash I work in.,
Can't wait to see this too zero![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
*Fuck you , you fucking vaccinated retard*
   Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳,
What was the most convincing part of his argument?,
Now buy moderna puts….I’m your friend,
You better give your friend some of that money. It's only good business,
Epic pro well done mate 👍🙂,
Have the same lol but have about 200 45 puts for march. There is a gap that needs to be filled and im praying it gets filled by then. It's crazy that this is holding up so well, back in august it touched 50-51 and it's just now reaching it again.,
A Win is a win... don't forget to set some aside for taxes,

Lol I hate this market so much,
At this point, the world is just chasing it’s tail.,
Says the guy that stands to make a shitload of money from that. 

Plus he probably bought puts on Friday and got pissed by the "it's mild" shit.,
“Ok hear me out, what if we tell them they need a different vax for every possible variant and we just make hella money”,
Guy who sells skin lotion, lotion 1.0 not as effective as lotion 2.0.,
I just don't care anymore,
Symptoms are supposedly mild. This might just be another Friday style overreaction. God willing nothing in America will get shut down and we continue with our lives. Y’all stay safe.,
Yep, better go get their new one they’re releasing. Good ol Uncle Sam will buy another round for the house. Yeah I hardly believe anything those people say anymore. They just figured out the infinite money glitch.,
This is why BAVARIAN will have the best vaccine eventually in 2022.,
Good looking out,
This guys a noob. Buying more calls,
I wonder why ? So Moderna can make more money printing vaccines,
Futures down bigly.,
Only until the new omicron vaccines which now leave a pleasant vanilla taste in your mouth 👅 forever,
moderna CEO pumps own stock, more news after the pause,
"likely"  
AHHHHHHHHHHHH,
We should short the shit out of that stock.

That prick is trying to line his pockets - create FUD, get more business and sell even more of his stock higher.,
Priced in. Next.,
This day was eventually coming, get busy living or get busy dying.,
Moderna's economy depends on this virus pretty much. A bit convenient for them this type of comment right?,
Someone get this fucker an @Jack pill,
The only confirmed thing is he said scientists are worried it could be bad.

Could you please stop that FUD now ?,
To be fair, he has a DIRECT reason to say so. Money,
Save yourselves, run for the hills, sell everything now 😂,
It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t kill anyone,
Translate to:

"We need more money from the world population for new patents that are gonna make us even more billions once again!",
But reporting from health officials in South Africa and Europe sya that even 1 vaccine keeps cases to mild and low symptoms.

Unvaccinated its still covid and kill or fuck you up,

i have $mrna at $372. I'm retarded,
And in 2 weeks he announces they have developed a booster for it. You get fucked he does stock buy-backs at the bottom and cashes in.,
HOW less effective?

Let's see.

'Natural immunity' via your immune system responding to a novel virus is ZERO % effective.

So if Moderna is \~90% effective against Alpha, +75% effective against Delta, as long as it's greater than FUCKING ZERO, it's still better to get the vax than not.,
They initially said this about Delta as well, which turned out to be exaggerated.,
Possible he is mostly saying this to shill the new updated vaccine that is supposed to come out in a few months. Regardless, Omicron looks scary and there is still a lot we don't know and can't know until we have more data with how it spreads, if it can evade existing antibodies, what it does to people. 

Reasonable possibilities range from nothingburger overreaction to totally fuckedness, and everything in between.

Worst case scenario is *if* Omicron evades antibodies, spreads super fast, *and* kills/seriously hurts a significant number of infected people. If all three are true, then we are basically back to Feb 2020 right now. 

Oh what's that you say? You are over the pandemic? Nobody cares anymore? Guess what bitch, the virus doesn't give a shit how you feel, it just wants to breed in you and use you as a springboard to breeding in your friends and your wife's boyfriend. *If* we get a worst case scenario, lots of places are probably going to lock down again in about a month or so, whether you like it or not. 

In the real world outside the brrrrrrrr-addicted stock market the economy is already pretty fucked up - YoY Producer Price Index inflation (usually a leading indicator for CPI) is [18.4% in Germany](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/german-ppi-739), [20.4% in Italy](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/italian-ppi-750) and MOTHERFUCKING [31.9% in Spain!](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/spanish-ppi-404) 

Even if Omicron is a nothingburger shit's all fucked up yo. If Omicron is not a nothingburger, the crash and/or inflation we are going to experience on top of our already completely boned global economic system is going to be wild.,

Who cares it has the mildest symptoms of all and is a sign that we are almost over it all.,
There a study from 2015 on chicken flu or something that shows vaccine that dont give life time immunity lead to vaccine resistant virus. But you will get flagged for talking about that on yourube.,
My calls ...,
"I think it's going to be a material drop. I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I've talked to . . . are like 'this is not going to be good.'"

Yeah I think I’d rather take my advice from scientists that have a more professional vocabulary.,
Heck of a pronounced, coupled with the rest of the world pretty much saying they simply don't have enough data about Omircron to say one way or another.  


I mean, it's a safe bet that the CEO is right, in the sense that it is unlikely the Moderna vaccine would miraculously turn out to be MORE effective against Omicron that it is against the variants it was specfically designed against, sure, but that's just common sense.  


Sure sounds like he's angling for more tax money.,
Maybe we should get rid of mandates then.,
Omicron will turn out well. It will continue to turn uneducated antivaxxers to dust. A win win for society.,

You just drew an imaginary line out of nothing, if anything this simply show a strong resistance at 18.98$,

Who needs fundamentals when you have imaginary lines?,
Anyone can draw lines on a chart...,
The first stock I ever bought back in the day. I made some good money for a first time degenerate.,

Does TA work well with commodity companies if so do it Dole or something.,
People actually believe in TA?,
wonder if we will see 100% weekly gains again.,
As a longtime bagholder, I encourage you to abandon all hope that this piece of shit will ever make money ever again,
Good trading point maybe reached for Canopy growth. 13 canadian Dollar is a good chance to turn with only one third risk. The upward potential would be not bad at all. Of course cannabis shares are high risky, but also a good potential when they start to gain. The spike on 15.11. could have been the trigger for upward potential.,

Woah. This is some solid ass DD. You really out pizzaed the hut with this one.,
Sure, im taking notes  loading on Spy call.,
Didn't we learn anything from the 80's when housing was rocketing up until the recession in the early 90's?

Didn't we learn anything as housing rocketed up from the mid 90's to 2000 and ended with a recession?

Didn't we learn anything as houses rocketed up from 2002 until 2008 and had the great recession?

Didn't we learn anything as houses rocketed up from 2011 until...

What I learned is, if your leveraged... your fucked. You will get flushed... everyone else will be fine and carry on like normal.,
Lol who cares about intrinsic value when the fed’s job now is to keep our dicks hard and wet,
But until March we go 🚀🚀🚀 Okay.,
You need to spruce this DD up with some plagiarism bro. 

Anyway, yes stocks are overvalued - but I know several people going broke trying to prove that to themselves. 

Don’t become another.,
Damn dude, futes go slightly red and 🌈🐻 come out in full force lol,
What are you shorting? Show us those big time Puts big daddy!,
Buy buy buy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
Position or ban,
Nostradamus,
calls on your wife and her boyfriend's quality time,
Lol wtf is intrinsic value. Define intrinsic value. I work for a IB and have a CFA. Let me tell you that Intrinsic value is fugazzi: it's a BS number made up by the banks to sell you their dogshit equity research reports 😂😂😂,
What’s that remind me bot? I’d like a reminder on March 31st 2022.,
March 2022? I thought the physic Indian predicted Feb 2021. Came and gone.,
Better than my theory that China won't let the market crash until after the olympics. Nobody likes a depressing olympics,
so buy electric vehicle stonks?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Show us your Q2 2022 spy puts or shut the fuck up,
it's not in the feds interest for a quick crash.  
they want a slow drawn out bleed,
Goodness, there's dozens of people predicting a crash this week on this sub along. More than one YOLO of SPY puts seen. When the consensus says there's a correction coming, you can be sure nothing will happen.,
🌈 🐻,
Man can we ever get a bull run in March… 2020 it was corona crash 2021 Nasdaq corrected…. What’s even the point of investing in March..,
He predicted the market crash of 2022, but now he’s warning of something even bigger…,
What catalysts make you believe 3/22 is doomsday? Anyone can say "our economy is leveraged and many asset classes will fall if one crucial one falters," that's not as convicted as "the housing market is propped up on bad loans and the majority of them will kick in in Q2 '07 which is when I will aim to exit my position.",
Where are all these prophetic 🌈🐻s coming from. Like chill, none of us can predict anything. The market can remain retarded longer than you can stay solvent.,
Let’s see those put positions or gtfo,
All, I have an important announcement to make.
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico.,
Thank you NOSRTADICKMUS,
2020 called, they want their speculations back,
The fourth major issue is gay bears like you using big words like "hypothesis" and "crash."

Stick to the words you know like "Guh.",
So what you're saying is this:

houses are going to crash in price.

Anyone going hooray! I CAN FINALLY AFFORD ONE LET'S GOOOO GET A MORTGAGE will hear "We are not lending money right now, let's wait until prices are sky high again and then we'll start lending money!"

People with hundreds of thousands in cash will scoop them up and rent em out or AIRBNB them and then sell them off for 5X the price once prices go back up.,
Post position pussy,
Wolf!!!!!!,
All in on whale oil calls then,
i'll do the opposite,
One problem - if/when the housing and stock market falter due to an interest rate increase & reduction of government propping, do you think the government won't realize it's nearing the midterms & just not do that & keep printing money and keeping rates low? We have zero tolerance for austerity. We didn't raise interest rates during Obama's 2nd term when the economy was rocking after the financial crisis was over. 
This is our endgame - massive and persistent inflation so we don't have to pay our debts. What's the government plan for when a gallon of milk is $10? You're going to hear the term "universal basic income" pop up. Everyone will work their shit jobs and the overages will be paid for by, you guessed it, printing money and giving it directly to people. The more you make, the less UBI you get. The world keeps spinning and when your wife stretches the elastic waistband of her thong for a tip from her boyfriend after shaking her ass to Lil Eminem X, he'll be sliding a C note in there because he wasn't a pussy and didn't pull out of the market, or anything else, and just bet that in 2023 LCID and RIVN were going to have the market cap of 2020 AAPL and NVDA and those two stocks cap would be worth more than most current day European countries. 

tldr brrrrrrrrrrrrr,
There is a genuine shortage of housing legacy of 2008 and then the COVID countermeasures piled on. This is ***unlikely to end in our lifetimes***. If builders go balls-to-the-walls it's going to take another seven years of rebuilding that industry just to get back to the production level needed to meet demand. i.e. For *at least* the next seven years construction will remain below demand level so for the next decade pent-up-demand will continue to increase. That's how it goes if there isn't any other problems slowing things down like a lack of materials to build them.  
  
> The third issue is partially correlated to issues one and two. This issue is the majority of stocks are currently priced massively over their intrinsic value.  
  
You are acting like the value of the dollar hasn't been eviscerated. Stock prices are about 75% of what they ought to be.  
  
Let's say people start to panic sell. Now what? Are you going to buy US bonds that are inflating away to half their value?  
Are you going to sit on cash and watch inflation climb towards 20%?  
What are you going to buy? Put 100% of it into real-estate?  
  
Stocks will continue to climb keeping pace with real-estate. Real-estate *sky-rocketed* this past year. The correction has been tiny. $300B of real-estate assets are a catalyst? We won't even feel that road-bump. BTD.  
  
The perverse catalyst for this bubble popping is the return to a sufficient flow of goods and people realizing this pandemic will never end so it's time to face destiny and live life again. Once that happens people will start spending their money on shit they want and need again instead of hording it while they sit at home. Which means we also now perversely find ourselves in a situation where the bull run doesn't end ... as long as a Democrat wins because they won't fix any problems. Probably will make them worse.,
Futures are taking a huge dump we need to gather the apes 🦧🦧🦧🦧,
This is only one bubble ready to pop. We are in for some 💩,
Priced in suck my balls,
bears wanna cry 💦💦,
Omg, that’s it he decoded Nostradamus prediction of the 3rd Antichrist meaning of MABUS. March Actual Bust US Stocks!! 

Yeah whatever! Nice try to scare all of us.,
tell me a week in advance when the market will crash and ill be thankful for u and can touch ur wiener in return if needed,
Puts on ?,
I'm sure finantial institutions are unaware of this and will be caught unprepared for such scenario.,
It's not that housing and equities (assets) have gone up, it's that the value of the dollar has gone down so much cause printer go brrr.,
I fucking wish…  I’d buy a house and long  shares of ETFs at a discount,
RemindMe! March 1 2022,
Pull out before it’s too late and buy the dip,
You missed the entire bubble u idiot, it popped in February 2021 and 80% of growth stocks are down 75% from highs, your a little late…,
Yo are assuming the fed won't start injecting more money at the first signs of a meltdown. It's an election year can't have a tanked market!,
the crash is now as the smart money knows you and many are thinking crash in march..so they are getting out now...classic rug pull..,
Silver it is. The original fixed supply currency of planet earth.,
Invest in ammo manufacturing, when this impending doomsday comes a bullet will be the best resource investment ever!,
Housing price might correct a little but will never crash.it will only go up and up. One day we might start talking about regular neighborhood houses going for 10-100 million dollars!,
I won’t be shocked if it does the complete opposite. (My thoughts),
[I'll just leave this little gem here from Mr. Dalio. Always true and sums up our current stage very nicely.](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0),
I don’t see the housing market having the same issues as 2008. For one thing there is a lot less supply of housing, that’s the main thing causing prices to shoot up. Single family home construction has been anemic for over a decade pre pandemic, lockdowns hit, and suddenly everyone realizes they want more space. These houses are selling for more than they are worth, but secondly and more importantly, there are a lot more regulations in place on giving out mortgages now than there were in 2007. The people buying these houses can afford them even if they are getting ripped off by the sellers for a massive premium.

Edit to add: “Everything is worth what it’s purchaser will pay for it.”,
The overall market is efficient. Pockets and single stocks might not represent that all the time, but the broader spectrum is.

All of the points you are making have one thing in common: They’re known to everyone. The market is not a living thing with its own mind, but rather the outcome of the actions of all participants. 
If a majority of those participants doubt that the values for equities will continue to go up and will instead be stagnant or even decline, they’ll get out and reallocate, which leads to a decline in the market.

With that being said, and all of your information that would lead to your scenario being known, why would people expect values to rise until then? If the fear was real, they’d get out. They would not wait until the FED raises rates. Why? Because a rate hike doesn’t make a difference to most investors. Do you know a single soul that invests into 10yr bonds? Would you move your money from $VOO into a savings account with 2% interest? You would not. 

There is no real alternative to the stock market providing the same returns and liquidity. Something will fear the participants at some point down the line and they’ll step to the sidelines. Eventually we will come out on top and break that previous ATH.

The moral of the story is, don’t be over leveraged, don’t try to time tops or bottoms and keep buying when companies you believe in are undergoing short term pressure.,
What a fresh idea. Market crash. Who would have thought of something so unique.,
Alright let’s see your PUTS for March 2022, otherwise let’s axe this post from the page.,
Guys we found another 🌈 🐻!! 
How many times do we have to teach u this lesson ?😂,
We had this guy at work years ago. Old salty guy who’d been there for decades. Everyone called him, “Shutdown”. He couldn’t speak without mentioning that the place was getting shutdown. Talking at the cube? Shutdowns! Pass him at lunch? Shutdowns! Taking a shit at work? Hey, buddy….shutdowns! 

Long story short. Shutdown died of cancer a few years back. I still work at this shithole. If there’s a heaven, it’s getting fuckin shutdown.,
Where are housing prices still going up? All I've noticed is it stagnating. Also why would the fed raise rates? They can't raise them much anymore die to skyrocketing federal debt. If they raise rates, more and more money goes to debt service.,
Writing is clearly on the wall. Well said fren. Also let not ignore the fact that Money Bags Powell can and will only print so much before his head is on the chopping block with this “TrAnSiToRY” Inflation.,
I've been saying this since beginning of covid but government just keeps printing $.. That only lasts so long..,
Someone give this guy the big brain award please.,
The US housing market is nothing like it was before the last financial crisis (people getting mortgages they couldn’t afford).,
No fucking way they raise rates in March.  Nothing till 2023 like they’ve been saying all along.  Especially now with the unicron varient bullshit,
RemindMe! 4 months,
In other news, gay bear is big gay.  More at 11...,
You know you're in for a good laugh when it start along the lines of "Many financial experts, including myself" ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
The S&P 500 is now red for the month of November. Historically not good..  Perhaps collectively or not the rug is getting pulled.,
Always think how the middle class will be fucked.,
Market crashed in 1929, 1987, 1999, 2008 hmmmm looks like it recovered nicely.,
Holy shit I hope the housing market crashes so I can buy a house,
The great market crash of 2025. Got it.,
Leverage is a car with 2,000 horsepower. 

You either get to your destination (gains) in record breaking time or you crash and burn (lose it all).,
Why would you say something like that! Now they'll have to change the date in an already planned 10 to 15% drop.,
&#x200B;

This is the first intelligent post I read on this sub.,
Thanks for the heads up, now i know i can get an extra 50k on my house!,
RemindMe! March 1 2022,
It will happen in December. As investors cash in to cover tax.,
RemindMe! March 1 2022,
It is happening now.
Won't affect housing market.,

Surprised you didn't use a crayon,
"anxiously holding bags" contains 3 parts of speech, none of which is an adjective, well done,
I cant stop laughing. This is gold,
Beautifully executed 😂😂😂,
Well done autist,
Solid DD. Fuck it im in!!!,
Anxiously holding bags is not an adjective you fucking boob.,
Way to smart to fill in all that.,
Wendys is a noun,
Nice,

What stonk are we buying?,
Oh wow. This is excellent on so many levels, especially the blatant disregard for adjectives. Good shit.,
So, it seems like this person really doesn't understand what a mad lib is. Or adjectives.,
You forgot to mention your fleshlight!,

I could not be more retarded for this trip! I’m dead lol,

So wish to the moon coming soon in 2022 buddy , hang in there .,

Interesting for an autist to write in cursive,
I'm barely old enough to know about mad libs lol,

I got assigned 1k shares last December at $18. Best move I ever made.,
Drs orders🚀🚀🚀,
Congrats!!!  I did the same thing twice and the puts paid for half the shares once I got assigned🚀🚀🚀,
Are we allowed to say good things about GME on this sub again??? Bullish.,
CSPs are the way if you like the stock!!! 🚀🚀,
Check finviz SI is at 113% of float again,
I bought 100 shares Friday. For a whole year now I've been afraid it'll drop 50%, but I don't think it will at this point. I'm not worried about missing the moon rocket. I'll just sell 30 delta monthlies and if I get assigned, that's great. 

Laaame, I know.,
I've been itching to sell covered calls on GME for like *six months* every time it rises to $225+, but after getting my covered calls on PTON (at $33) and ZS (at $55) exercised I just couldn't bring myself to add one more mark to that column,
I see GME, I upvote. I may be a simple ape, but I know what I like.... the stock.,
DRS is next,
Now you gotaa DRS those,
you might be getting more friday too...,
You know about DRSing your shares yet??,
you're a pretty cool guy. i like this stock,
Uh oh boss, you're in for a treat,
This,
What a beautiful Black Friday gift 🎁,
Actually I got assigned that's why u have no choice but to go in. Stop hyping that as YOlo for clout and upvote u greedy pig boi,
how much premium have you been able to collect each week?,
#GME = MONEY 💰,
Fuck your puts but also probably will bang next week,
What are csps?,

These are about to print hard.,
what the fuck do you know that we don't??,
My spirit told me to buy UVXY but I believed in the pump,
Spy hates you right now lol,
He's fucking rich,
Close it now. Uvxy leap puts FTW,
This takes some brass balls.

I'll be loading up on puts after the next run.,
Damn you going to fucking print dude pls post gains,
Load up on vix puts this morning if you guys didnt buy vix calls like this dude,
Be careful holding these too long. The vix is mean reverting and will also come back down.  Plus thee curve is usually in contango, so at expiration when the fund rolls forward they are paying a higher price for the new front month contract,
Ruh roh,
Plz post gain porn,
Was about to buy calls on this and decided against it now I wish I had,
[deleted],
Wow the balls…. and you’re using a yahoo finance toddler chart to back up your theory! Holy shit,
Bro, please listen. Idk what kind of money you have to be gambling 1 mil like this, but I PROMISE YOU, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. 

Maybe you've convinced yourself that 1M isn't enough to retire at your age, and you're totally right, but it sure as hell is enough to get you BIG MONEY without doing fuckshit like this. Once you pass $5M, it's all the same. You don't need to do it in a month. 

You can do covered calls, spreads, wheel something for consistent income, leave stock in growth companies or an ETF, MOST OF THESE GUARANTEE you won't BLOW UP. Contribution to loss porn and like 2k karma doesn't feel that good, it's not worth.,
I thought having 1 Million makes you take less risky trades. I don’t understand why one has to swing for the fences with such large account.,
Godspeed my friend. May Zoom never go the way of Skype.,
When did you buy? Before or after Thursday AH? Omricon came to the media Thursday night.,
I mean, the company now has an EV/unlevered cash flow in the low thirties. That's like Google level multiples, for a company still growing faster than the 20-30% rate Google has for the past decade.

If you don't think they're just gonna go away in the next couple years, they're downright reasonably priced right now.,
It's on its way to <$200 as I type.,
Nice. Im loaded up on 5/22 150 P for this stock, Goodluck to you as you have far more money than I do but I think this stock is super over valued even at its current price point.,
💰 🖨,
Too many screenshots, show + - only,
How do I do these calls? I’m so confused on option trading,
Er. I'm confused. When were AAPL calls ever able to get this kind of return? 3k to 169k? Wtf...,
How do you get a 5000% return from an 8% increase in SP?,
What were your plays with the 3k to start that amazing run? Pics make no sense since they’re all from trades closed today. Congrats and fuck you btw! That’s an insane return,
Sell it all and run start over with 3k don’t be like me :(,
It’s nice when they work and it really hovered at. 150 for weeks (months) before breaking out and up to 160,
THE HIGH YOU MUST BE ON RN,
Impressive photoshop but your missing the red crayon 🖍,
When did you buy the calls and what strike price?,
I find this a little hard to believe but there has been a huge run up (even with Fridays dip) would have had to enter and exit several perfectly timed points but I doubt all these recent 100k+ accounts on Robinhood making 20-100x returns in a month,
I really wonder how the fuck Apple calls have given u this much returns. Anyways congrats 👍,
Waking up to see that type of portfolio is my dream brotha! Way to fucking go, $AAPL to the mooooonnn!,
SEC this guy right here...congrats and fk u,
Sell And enjoy your returns wisely. Wait for another dip entry may be lol. Too much to let go. At least for me.,
And here I sold at a loss. Fucken market is not fair.,
Get your taxes straight,
Jesus Christ tickle my pickle and lick my bum hole but congrats good gains,
obscene. The apple EV rumour spreader is this guy.

SEC Officer, this guy right here sir!,
congrats and fuck you.... that's absurd,
2 n, pm,

Hmm, thinking of following based on the battery alone,
I thought Nio day was Dec 18th?

You playing the potential run up?,
God speed…I wouldn’t be all in on anything after Powell’s comments today..let alone Chinese stocks 🤣

Welcome home retard.,
0% out on battery day,
I’m here with you. Calls and shares. XPEV and LI are trading just as well as they did last year around this time while NIO……smh,
So many better options today than NIO,

Which is to be expected. Gambling is sure money and it’s getting more and more popular. What makes no fucken sense is that all gambling tickers have been getting shit on while random shit keeps going up. They’re one of the few things that don’t care about Covid they can make money if shutdown or no shutdown with all the online gambling.,

Wtf were those kids trying to do, rap?  Please neuter those boys,
In my situation, "What my family thinks I do" should also be the last clip,
its not cool to make fun of those mentally handicapped island rappers,
They look like a couple of extras from *Apocalypto*.,
What the two bozos doin,
Ahh the boys I saw behind the Wendy’s making their sick rap video while I was taking out the trash.,
The island boys look like palm trees… guess that makes sense.,
Dudes up there looking like Donnie from the Wild Thornberrys.,
Holy shit, I got chills from the cringe,

Really thought the last clip was going to be cartman from the world of Warcraft episode… someone re do it,
Does anyone think so many people really want to have their hair like that and act that way and have face tatoos or do you think they are doing it because they think it will increase their chance of becoming rich and famous?

Im talking about the ending, not the beginning lol,
Those two lads are as obnoxious af,

Kimbal gave away 25,000 shares. Hey yo Kimbal, I just want 100 bro,
He probably don’t even click the “confirm order” button himself. What’s the point of stonks at all if not the fleeting pleasures of clicking the little red and green boxies.,
ItS OnLy PaPeR wEaLtH,
she probably had a loan from Goldman against her shares as collateral , and a very low interest rate, so I am guessing no,
Why is the most recent sale price on 11/23 listed as $344, while all the others seem like the market price at the time?,
I wonder if this has anything to do with his SpaceX email,
Check out this German Tesla song. Bunch of gorillas in the video. https://youtu.be/NoyaFRrtzgY,
Market is crashing, best to get out on top,
“Maybe I am, hard to tell” a true WSB enthusiast,
The vegeta theme gives me a hard on every time.,
Omicron really does sound like the name of an anime villain,
Why would you cut out, "Still think I'm bluffing?", at the end?,
Man I don’t remember. What episode. Vegeta is bad ass!! It’s true. As kids you like Goku grown up you appreciate vegeta,
I need those shades,
**SPY 500 EOY**,
77 x SPY 12/10 475C bought Friday at the open dump.

Sold at big spike open, up bigly.

Like a true degenerate I took all that profit and more into 0DTEs

50 x 465 0 DTE

10 x 464 0DTE

Got a bag, 112%, sold.

Probably going to rally more but profit is profit

#BEARS GIT FUKD,
Tremendous as always. Bulls on parade!,
I don't know anything about the stock market I'll just buy memes instead.,
Loved it (noob so I didn’t really get it lol),
DBZ and WSB. My two favourite ways to waste my life,
This funny af fam,
NGL, this shit is so good! spit out my coffee when I saw the shades,
Is is omicron gone today. I thought I was stupid for gambling on calls.,

doomsday is upon us,
I've just realized that his hair still stands and waves about like there isn't any gravity at all (and i guess that goes for any character in an increased gravity scene). Their clothes/hair should be flattened (Assuming it's like human hair). What are we to believe? That he has some sort of super strong and magical hair or something? pushes glasses up. Boy I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.,
Yeah, people are immune to covid fud!,
When the DBZ memes start rolling its a bullish signal for sure.,
Oh pui pui, you little bitch,
im trying to unpoor myself before the end of the year. and yes vegetas theme gives me the dongus cooties,
Well, he said his hopes of profiting sucked AFTER the stone stopped falling, so he actually has a 100% of profiting.  
L,
solid meme bro,
Vegeta is a bad-ass.,
I spent $4K total on the dip today ,.last Wednesday and last Friday.,
Ohh boy, god bless you

Red day incoming!!! Future index are wrecked,
Can’t wait for the over 9000 memes. Hopefully they come soon (for obvious reasons). Even if it requires using .SPX instead of SPY.,

But the lightning bolt didn’t hit nasdaq, it hit a shake shack!,
If you don't have 3 points on a trend it ain't a trend,
That's only if you're looking at it from the north. If you're looking at it from the south it's bullish af,
Most powerful TA i've seen on this sub in a while!,
A descending wedge is bullish btw.

A descending channel (which is what this is) is bearish.,
Would be more convincing if you drew a wedge 🤷‍♂️,
[deleted],
Short $ZEUS,
I'm a Chinese, I read from right to left. It's stonks.,
As an actual weatherman I can add this is sound advice.,
The god of stonks is upon us!,
Short the nasdaq and buy what? Nothing matters besides tech. Sell and keep cash and lose to inflation?,
this is God going short,
Thor has spoken,
Can’t argue with science 🤷‍♂️,
Ride the lightning!,
So buying calls on TQQQ checks with chart!!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
It’s hit the bottom nowhere to go but up. And that’s a wedge in a channel.,
😂😂,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
*MuH TeChNiCaLs*,
😂💎🙌,
Foolish bear that is a bullish sign, zoom out,
stupid noob, that’s a descending triple shoulder. god is shorting earth. see yall on the other side,
have u seen a lightning which goes up?,
It just about hit its lows, probably a reversal  into the new year,
I'm gonna allow this,
Clearly this is a graph of my current account balance (Call positions).,
i do my dd by throwing animal bones and interpreting the pattern,
Where are we today on this graph?,
Looks like a bear trap to me, go long!,
waow this is good news for my portfolio,
“At the beginning here we had straight up fuckery and now we are headed into a downtrend. After the latest earnings call, there appears to be no rebound in sight.”,
Lightning can only go up, I'm bullish.,
ackchuallyyy, a descending triangle with a breakdown,
Buy the house that got hit.,
Don't forget the wicks. They are stoplosses getting fucked,
Lol,
Bottom bounce for sure,
The prophecy has come upon us, mortals! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Lighting goes from the ground up so it’s bullish,
duh, everyone knows that lightning travels upwards (source: zikipedia).,
*Bill Nye has entered the chat

"Lightning goes both ways, just like your Mom, you little twat.",
 Lunch time to short, I would like to let someone hard to handle his meal. BTW, Asians will  sleep in the moment.,
Doesn't get more clear than that.,
But that's on the 1-microsecond time chart.,
Channel\*...,
I'm at the other side of town and [this is looking bullish](https://imgur.com/NU8KdhX),
This is the sort of DD we call come for!,
Wedge? Dafuq,

"Technical Analysis",
Hi I am Arab and this looks bullish to me.,
So what youre saying is energy prices are coming down according to technical analysis, genius,

Landing from the moon > to the moon,
I love Reddit,
God showing his predictions for tomorrow,
That’s not a wedge.,
If only the lightning was shooting up from the ground, that would be a clear bull flag,
Would be interesting to see a reversal from there,
Elon's new weather machine, clearly. Time for more tesla calls,
Buy the dip now or regret it later!,
Thor has spoken , to valhallaaaaaa,
I will choose to go from down to up..,
Aged like milk.,
When you have been staring at charts too long,
dummest shit today 🏆,
Approved,
Lmao that's almost exactly what TWTR looks like,
That looks nothing like a wedge,
Isn't it time to buy when it tough the bottom line? 😅,
Apple developed lightning port. Does this mean I should short Apple?,
Think that is a cup and handle formation with a broken handle,
tampa lightnings? you short them too?,
Not a wedge lol but yea, I’m all in,
you can totally catch that lighting in a bottle. It means YOLO, then yolo again when it dips,
I can't judge. I've used automobile traffic  volume to gauge volatility.,
Ita completely bottomed you absolute retard,
But that's a Bullish falling wedge though....,
🤦‍♂️Nice wedge!!🤯 ull fit in here just fine🤣🤣😭☠,
Except that's a bullish pattern...,
How’d that go?,
Looks like my damn PLTR you would think a top AI company would perform a little better in a bull market.,
Bottom of the channel, greatly over sold. Time to  yolo and get long,
Its a sign from the celestial apes,
No you see, that's an ALL timeline of your portfolio value.,
What is VIVA GE SI?    Looks like a watermark right dead center above the buildings,
#YES,
Someone didn’t play the shape game growing up,
Stonks is becoming astrology really fast now,
The lightning dipped low, went back in time, and dipped lower,
Perspective matters. from underneath it, it goes to the moon, from the other side, it goes the opposite of this. It's a the magic of the stock market, which only goes up,
Lightning still has solid fundamentals. Now might be a great opportunity to get in at a nice discount!,
Hands down the best TA i have ever seen,

Hey /u/Rauf_KB, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Himax Technology sounds like the brand names of stuff you get off Wish or the Chinese manufacturers who ship straight to Amazon fulfillment warehouses, and then pay to get their ratings up on Amazon so that you get conned into buying their cheap shit.

Therefore, I'm in 🦍🦧🚀🧑‍🚀🍆💦

94 x HIMX 1/21/22 16C

Will get some shares tomorrow when I close these SPY options.,
Saw title, bought HIMX. When can I rich?,
12/3 CSP $10 executed.,
3000 shares, been adding when I can.  I just can’t wait for that sweet ass dividend.  Trying to get to 5k shares by then.,
How can they have a book value of 4.17 per share if "They are fabless, meaning they contract factories and buyers through their patents, of which they have a shit ton. This means they have minimal overhead" this is true?  What are their assets?,
Seems like a pretty good deal,
Humm, that's a very low P/E and high dividend which means little growth planned. Seems like an excellent value pick but I'm hardly seeing rocket potential.,
Unreal how undervalued it's at,
Heard Taiwan and semiconductor

I’m in,
I’m in you bastard!!!,
1000 shares here. I might as well just be a semi fund at this point with INTC, TSM, NVDA, MRVL as well.,
Interesting one. Any reasons why this has not been picked up/noticed by funds? 2017-2019 growth does not seem great but last two years is pretty good. Profits, positive cash flow, clean balance sheet.

Couple of questions on my end:

i) Do you know what segment of semiconductors do they target? I am assuming these are low end of the spectrum, which is totally fine but want to understand the competition vs some of the others from SE Asia.

ii) Given absolute low $ sales figure, is there a big customer concentration that could possess risk?,
I have 300 shares, no idea why it's been floundering. Stupid undervalued,
They also sell semiconductors for AR and VR glasses relatable to metaverse experiences. Could be a growing market opportunity and catalyst if they find the right company to work with.

At this eps and marketcap definitely a no brainer. Posted a DD a while back, already in ballsdeep,
Had not heard of this company, thank you very much for sharing OP. **Been a long time since I've seen a post this good on here.**

Reminds me of the first time I heard about TSM - some dude made a post on here about it around Nov 2019, bought shares and LEAPS and made bank thanks to him. 

Not sure if I'm gonna buy calls on this one because it might take a while for it to move but buying a shit ton of shares and will collect the sweet ass dividend until it does. Will also be selling PUTS on this.

Thanks again OP - we need more quality posts like this.,
Thanks for the find, in a for a few hundred shares,
No brains you say!?,
Just leaving a comment here so I remember about this when my pay comes in,
Himx? This the same concept as Latinx?,
I’m in,
Well I know where my next pay cheque is going,
Holding shares and calls,
Just look at the market cap 1.7b right now and add up all the revenues they have this year. Within 1 and half year or so they will make the market cap back lmao very undervalued,
I have shares and bought calls on this November 1, which I sold after watching them bleed out for the last few weeks. Watch it pump now. 🙃,
Fucking dumbasses buying this shit, they didn't even announce an EV yet,
Yup. 1,200 shares at $8 and a 2022 deep ITM call. Love the rocket ships but your missing a penis or two.,
HIMX has always been just on the edge of take off.  They never do.  I invested in them 10 years ago and sold for breakeven or loss.  Kinda forgot they were still around.,
So how heavy is your bag? Did ya buy in at 17,
2,000 shares and 50 Jan $11 calls...HIMX gang checking in! Been holding for a couple weeks now and been watching the manipulation on this since then. Fundamentals are there so this should be a really easy buy...retail will get this back to a more appropriate valuation that it deserves. Stupid shorts.,
"Also 15% short interest add some spice to the stock." and sus amount of awards? yeah no thanks..,
Told you smooth brains about this one a year ago; I wonder how many listened, and how many were working the dumpster behind the Wendy's...

Are they making the semiconductors for the cars specifically or low quality ones?,
FMV is $25.

Edit: minimum,
Sold put, bought leap,
i had 50 11 dollar 26 nov calls that expired to worthless. bought them in august. rip. the pe ratio is insane and there is chip shortage and for some reason, the price is still going down. might get into it again someday..,
Pretty good idea, bro.  Thanks

With weekly options available this looks like a decent CC or Wheel play also. Looks like 2-3% a week if my math is right.,
My pee pee hard.,
Lets go!!🚀🚀,
okay guys great job. got some calls as well. 

now whos gonna buy the stock?,
It’s discounted as China may take over Taiwan and nationalize these businesses,
I'm not trying to knock OP. He actually seems to be getting better at DD, but remember, not everything is a guaranteed homerun in this game.


 Always check out previous DDs by OP before you drop money.

OP, thanks for posting. Keep looking for those diamonds in the rough. I'm out on this one though.,
THIS IS GONNA BE HUGEEEE  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 TO THE MOON!,
So here’s some DD for you.

I’ve noticed several of these being posted over the last several months… each one these usually has a $0.01-$0.05 spread on calls.

At the given price the calls are probably only really worth $0.01. But RH in particular regardless of your manually set limit, wont execute unless your bid is set to the maximum $0.05.

THIS IS A MONEY MAKING SCHEME… that benefits those offering the stock options. Given that the price is probably really only worth $0.01 and you buy at $0.05, they are safe unless price goes up 500%. Which it isn’t likely to do.

For you what’s $5.00? That’s a lotto scratcher right? You have almost 10 million in this sub. If only 10% buy this lottery ticket for $5 and it expires worthless. Those offering the stock option earn an easy $5 million.

This my friends is how institutions like Citadel are slowly making their money back.

OP is a shill… not an ape.,
you have to look at the margins of this vs. amd as well if want a true comparison. AMD's margins are higher and total addressable market is much bigger and why you see the valuation discrepancy,
Wait, they went from $2 to $15 and now back down to $10. How on earth did their stock not catch up when it went 7x and now a bit back down?

This just sounds like offloading your bags in tech-stock peak-buying.,
Have you considered Taiwan/China political tension?,
Would you advise calls or stick with stocks and the long game?,
Just read a story that BMW had to ship cars without touch screen option installed. Sounds like serious demand...,
Y'all about to get fucked,
Time to short HIMX,
Some short dick is playing games with HIMX.. constantly shorted to hell. No one has made money on this in months. You may be right, but I promise your return will be nothing other than WISH dogshit

Edit:  OP I checked your comment and post history and looking at all the previous tickers you’ve pushed, I’m SO f’n out.,
 NVDA,
They charged me triple the price than my local pharmacy. Sounds like the new Wish to me.,
This stock is literally on my "do not touch" list.

It's based in Taiwan, do you NOT know wtf is going on there?,
[removed],
I had this at some point this year and had calls...made a sweet profit when it hit $15. Haven't looked at the price yet ...I'll jump in again. Alot of portfolio managers and fund managers buy this junk Because big pee pee brokers and fund managers in wallstreet say it's a good pick in their monthly subscriptions.,
I like netlist better in this space. Seems much more promising. But I’m a dumbass.,
Semis are actually a shitty business. I looked into opening a factory and what I learned is that the big guns; Samsung and TSM, will flood the market to destroy competitors. This doesn’t apply for shortage era. 


The capital requirements are enormous. These have to be changed to make new types or lines or something eventually, so that capital investment isn’t good indefinitely. 

TSM and Samsung will also lower margins to fight for market share. 

Overall it’s not a great business to be in. Even for the big companies, they have to lose profit to kill off competitors. 


Also thank god you mentioned the current ratio. Where would we be without that.,
I will avoid any stock that the company is in China, that includes Taiwan because fucking China is gonna take it by military force. Just a time bomb waiting to explode,
China is thinking this is the case too and may want to get in on the action.,

A spike in revenue was all that drove ur 500k investment? Jesus. Fucking moron. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
You’re gonna be mad when it drops below $8, I hope you sell me your shares when it does,
Just curious, have you ever used the product before throwing 500k into its stock?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
UNDERVALUED,
I applied at this place and got through a couple interviews, then they told me I had to download and use the product before we could move forward.... Holy fuck what a racket..  Idk any sane person that would play this shit. Wsb has better returns.,
Why get a CFD and not the shares ? I understand using CFDs when you short as you don’t need to borrow the shares… but for longs, I never figured it out,

Hey /u/Hot_Significance_483, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Agreed. I don’t understand software/tech companies, but goddamn I love companies that sell chips. QCOM, MU, and Frito Lays are my top holdings.,
Why are you so interested in this stock?  Do you have a position in it?

WSB tradition: *positions or ban.*,
Instructions unclear. Bought quantumscape.,
Do we has insider?,
Been in since $53/ share $$,
Where are they located ?,
I used to work at a company that stress texted Qualcomm chips. Their employees always seemed slammed and stressed out. They like to churn out product at a high pace I guess,

The real question is whether or not Citadel is shorting the HOOD.,
VLAD:

“DISABLE THE SELL BUTTON!!!”
==================================

“WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY IN BULGARIA…WE DIDN’T HAVE SELL BUTTONS!!!”
==================================,
I feel like finding out that Robinhood is massively shorted is right up the retards alley.,
All stocks have their ups and downs.  The only way you'd have lost money in HOOD is if you got in sometime between the IPO and 10:30 this morning.  Outside of that window and you're looking at a green plate of tendies.,
A moment of silence for those who paid $70 for this piece of garbage.,
Sold a put I bought a week ago.  Feels good man.

Gains!

(Purchased $HOOD 26.00 P 12/03 @0.79 on 11/23),
Ain’t karma a bitch.,
Obligatory “fuck vlad and the horse he rode in on” comment.,
Oh chill.  Could easily pop.  Have seen dreadful financial stocks being manipulated and rocket,
I've said this so many times. I have a 5 dollar put on this piece of shit company. Can't wait to exercise it,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Die, HOOD, die... January will not be forgotten!,
😂😂😂 fucking beautiful!,
How long before this gets acquired by some other broker for their customer base?,
makes sense. their only moat was free trades (long gone) and a slick mobile app compared to competitors (some still fucking suck - looking at you merrilledge), then fucked their probably most loyal and active userbase during the gme saga. sad chart for a young boy from bulgaria,
Perhps no company deserves this more for what they did to their customers.....next take away payment for order flow from their model and watch HOOD, WISH, and PSFE all trade under $4.,
They better add more , Crypto, and open up to more  penny stocks, warrants.  If they want to survive. Lot of Crypto, stocks you can't buy on ,Robinhood. That other brokers allow.,
As they should! Deuces, there are far better trading platforms and way better investment apps. SoFi comes to mind as my favorite overall financial app, then Chuck or any of the discount brokers have better trading interface/tools.. oh and while they scrambled did not turn off the buy button!,
Im not a big fan of watching companies die.....

But fuck if I am not a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 when it comes to Bulgaria Boy.  I hope to never see that face again unless its giving me actual tendies at Wendy's.,
Haha fuck you robinhood, you piece of shit.,
What was the IPO? 65?,

Nicee,
I cannot believe I listened to retards in here when TSLA was hovering around $500 and all the Burry cocksmokers were going on about how TSLA was overvalued blalala its going to crash blalala.. Now look at the fucking bitch - over $1000 and won't go down even one day without a bounce 5X stronger the next.,
Sell or your penis will fall off,

Nice,
Dude, NICE!,

Nice,

Just started talking to this girl - she buys the latest iphone, iwatch, airpods, new car this year, gifts her friends airpods but she too broke and lives in a basement 🤔

I bought apple calls right away,
Finance textbook: "Constantly buying calls on big tech at ATH is not a viable investment strategy."


Real life: "lmao",
Some of y’all are such perma-bulls that there could be an alien invasion and this sub be like “SPY 700 EOW” 

That’s why I love you guys.,
When I buy calls at ATH, it drills. When I buy puts, it moons. I’m about to start buying both,
My portfolio is 70% cash losing 6% a month to inflation and 30% options losing 60% every other day to theta,
Made $18 today. I'm like fucking Citi Bank ova here,
SPY drops like 20 cents and the bears act like they're having the best prostate orgasms of their life,
The problem with all of this is based around how difficult it is to consistently make 15%+ off trading and how insanely easy it is to lose 30%+,
Never selling NVDA seems to have worked again.,

Fed has repeated shown they will print to prop the market up to keep boomers from going to the poor house.

Inflation is skyrocketing, guaranteeing even shares in stagnant companies will go up simply to break even with  real value.

Jpow just said omicron could make inflation worse, which is his way of shouting in your face that the fed will print again if needed, regardless of moral hazard.

You see what I'm saying? Real value has to go down faster than inflation is going up for the market to actually go down.  

To recap.

A down economy is a flat market.

A flat economy is a bull market.

A growing economy is a double fisted chad fuckening market.

Its not Covid you dolts.  Institutions were waiting for something ,anything, to blow off and stick retail.  The real problem for them is that the fed is tapering and your beloved money printer is going to turn off.  Its not covid.  The market likes covid.  Its the taper. This is just and excuse to take profits and make retail "buy the dip".  Ya'll getting had, holding bags.,

Gather round, young degens.

Since the sub began, our newer members have held onto a belief - like children with Santa Claus.  They stay up all night talking about it.  The older but still innocent begin to see the inconsistency and stand up proudly to announce their disbelief in an attempt to impress their peers, but they, too, secretly hold onto a hope that they are wrong, that the cherished illusion will hold for another day.  But reality comes to us all, young degens.

The hard truths are these:

Futes aren't real.

Mods are gay.

Does anyone else feel like they’re just slowly bleeding out? Like you hit a few nice calls occasionally but for the most part you just get fucked.,
Holy shit these vaccine company CEOs need to shut the fuck up and let scientists without a financial interest in Omicron do their jobs. More people would take the shot if the companies presented better.,
Friday was an emotional day. Thoughts of "here we go again with this covid shit" permeated through minds of traumatized souls. It triggered memories of March 2020 when limit up and down were the norm. So it's unsurprising traders opened puts, so don't 🐝 too hard on yourself, you were just "hedging."

Bottom line: when shit hits the fan, that same shit falls down on a bears face,

if its continues we will need to tell kids that Santa died during pandemic.,
You know what’s crazy, I’m laying in bed right now at 4 am watching imagine numbers on my super device and just 100 years ago motherfuckers were riding around on horses. Thank god I’m alive today,
Moderna Ceo be like I am the market now.,
 I’ve already lost 90% of my portfolio this month yet it still somehow goes down every day ☹️,
Hit my first $10k profit day…. Yeesh…  I just need to do this 10 more times then I’m done.,
portfolio was up 140% today 😎

*^its ^still ^3 ^figures ^though*🤫,
Printer stays on. Inflation will continue into next year so no rate hikes for another year. Keep buying calls and do cocaine.,
#WE DID IT BOYS WE BEAT COVID,
If you had bought and held 1 $NVDA share from last week close you would’ve made $20 bucks. I bet thats more than what 50% of the monkeys here made today.,
NVDA is such a powerhouse.,
I was so wrong about NVDA.

I always thought to myself, who cares? Just another chip company… guys like Apple will make their own soon enough and put them out of business. Everyone will use their own chips for cheap. 

Apple did end up making its own chip, but NVDA has more than 5x since I told myself that and still charging higher with monster retard strength. 

Honestly it’s performance is more shocking to me than TSLA’s,
Life is fucking garbage when your losing consistently as broke as fuck paycheck to paycheck fuck living. I’m being so serious too this shit is fucking real life depressing play after play after play being losses and barely being able to scrape by really does something to a person,
were having another 2% day tomorrow mark my words

i transferred money to my broker over the weekend to buy the dip so the market is gonna blow right past ATH to fuk me before i can buy shit,
SPY should be 475,
BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME

STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!,
I like how elon tweets that he's taking a shit and people are trying to divine the next TSLA split from it. Imagine being so powerful that you can move markets by tweeting about taking a dump.,
Bro I think I just saw a ghost 😳

He looked kinda retarded like Bill Hwang or something,
I'm not asking for much, SPY ATH EOW is adequate,
Found out today you can get a loan to pay for your wedding. These people cray cray.,

Went to closet 


Put on nice long sleeve to head to pub in

Refreshed

Guess I’ll be going to Wendy’s instead,
It’s kind of wild how one guy saying something can make millions of people lose money overnight.,

People who bought SPY puts today are the type of people to poop in bars,
Imagine panic selling because of a mild variant two years into a pandemic. I will never understand this world.,
I check WSB before the news lol,
futures rise after traders realizing we've been in a pandemic for the last 2 years,
Is it normal to hate yourself after eating a ton of chips?,
jizzlaine gonna rat on the billionaires that made her rich? let see how this goes.,
If you can't handel me at my -.5% then you don't deserve me at my ATH,
God Europeans are sad. Pretty sure they teach kids how to liquidate their portfolios in 2nd grade.,
I maxed out my credit card to buy calls 🤡. I’m gonna have to ask Chase for an extension on the payment date,
Omg the market is such a drama queen, overreacting to everything….i just wanna smack its fucking face and yell “calm the fuck down bitch”,
Bulls: “70% of the time, the holiday season is bullish”

Welcome to the other 30%.,
The good news is, we can lose everything but $10 and still retire in Turkey.,
Bond market is cratering. You guys are in much more danger than you understand,
SPY opening above $468 would be very cash money,
Yo this Arcane series isn't bad. Don't know anything about League Of Legends either

Last animated stuff I watched was Love, Death & Robots and not much between watching Akira and that,
I thought we did a double top. I was wrong. We'll have a triple top.,
Santa vs. Omicron,
I'm all in on SPY 12/31 477Cs... got several dozen now. 

I'm either going to make a year's salary, or I'm going to lose a month's salary. Fingers crossed.,
AMD 170 EOW,
Money isnt fucking real,
Balls deep in TSLA & MRNA calls. So fucking hyped for tomorrow,
I have a feeling a lot of people were purged from the sub this week.,
Damn Elizabeth Holmes is a truly awful person,
Imagine owning the biggest sports entertainment outlet in the world and not **already owning** a complementary sports betting service. Looking at you DIS you stupid fucking rat,
Imagine betting against stocks when all of civilization is designed around them going up.,

"The chief executive of Moderna has predicted that existing vaccines will be much less effective at tackling Omicron than earlier strains of Covid-19 and warned it would take months before pharmaceutical companies can manufacture new variant-specific jabs at scale."

MRNA ceo says vaccine may be less effective on omicron…didn’t we know this already? Everyone was saying this shit over the weekend. Feels like this is another buyable dip,
Amazing. The CEO of the company that creates vax says "that shit we injected you with will probably not work, your bitchass gon need this new shot THAT WE WILL CREATE by early 2022" and suddenly the whole world goes ape shit. FUCKING SCAM,
How can the future be coming back if it hasn’t yet happened,
I literally don’t care and these nerds say they got a pill and can make a new vaccine pretty quick. Ain’t no one scared we just want to live like the before times again,

Let me get this straight, Moderna CEO said “I’ve talked to all the best scientists, and they said like this isn’t good, I mean it’s good for us but it’s not good for your sniffles”

Taking notes right out of Donnie Pump’s book.

It’s coming back boys,
For anyone too lazy to scroll down. Financial Times dropped an article where the CEO of Moderna said he *thinks* that current vaccines wont be nearly as effective against Omicron based on the mutations they're seeing based on his expert opinion.

We dont have any data confirming that and maybe he is wrong, maybe Omicron is less deadly or less harmful, we dont know yet so it's really speculation, but coming from someone like him it carries weight and the markets dont like it,

Biontech is the best!,
2-6 weeks to evaluate; 100 days to new vaccine … both companies will make huge profits … kinda that simple,
Pfizer seems to be the only one that the fda likes.  Moderna keeps having issues getting fully approved.,
Moderna needs to be fired into the sun for the comments the other day. Totally spooked people and the market with no good evidence.

At least Pfizer are staying calm and doing the research.,
See what Nancy pelosi buys more of,
neither, novavax maybe…
(not invested in vaccine companies atm),
Neither it’s a hoax,
IMO they are both played out.  Wait and see,
Moderna is trash ... BNTX just look at earnings/market share/ Pipeline/ insider sales / approvals,
Nvax,
Both.,
This snake oil tastes like cum but that doesn't stop me from drinking it,
[deleted],
None, both vaccines dont work in this new variant. AND most important, the new variant hasn't been lethal so far. Just mild cases. The new variant IS the new vaccine. That's exactly why every government is losing it's mind. They know this. They'll be losing all their new found powers.,
moderna’s vaccine and booster are stronger than pfizer’s..note that vast majority of the breakthrough cases and breakthrough cases w omicron are with pfizer or something else not moderna. moderna for some reason doesnt jive well with the fda advisory board and is less willing to release data, which is why pfizer is preferred by the fda/cdc.  the data from this year and next year though will show that moderna vaccine holds up the best…long MRNA. also long PFE but mainly because they manufacture more than the vaccine but also the antiviral.,

None . But if you wanna ride the wave 🌊 go with Pfizer . Ceo always have good news,
Biontech is the way!!,
Murderna CEO with a rare but unavoidable honest statement, Modena vaccine does NOT work against variants! Hell it never worked against any of them !

Let's go INOVIO! First safe and effective vaccine against covid-19 it's...INO-4800/4802,
It's not a sure thing, but most successful organisms mutate to be MORE coooperative with their surrounding biosystems.  In the case of a virus, this means they tend to become LESS deadly as they mutate (albeit more contagious.)  


This means, in turn, that the current hysteria about Omicron might be misguided, and indeed the very early initial data suggests that Omicron might just be following this pattern, of becoming more contagious but less deadly.  


This means there is a very real possibility that Omicron might be able to evade these vaccines AND be something not particularly worrying.  


So...my take in neither.  This is a good time, IMO, to sit on the sidelines and look to pick up some value plays once emotions fade.,
Neither. Check out Inovio (INO) for the tendies,
 It’s spelled Nvidia,
SORRENTO - SRNE,
this stocks are worst then crypto, it's just pump and dump,
Neither… it’s the fashion of the week only to drop like a stone in a few days,
No Omicron in the metaverse. 🤷🏽‍♂️,
Neither.  Just throw your money out of a moving vehicle,

You’re eating a 30% daily loss on theta decay alone,
yea go up bitch,
Open at 470 plz,
you must buy at the top! 466.48? this morning?,
That's a literal cointoss trade.,
That’s what I’m saying bro I got 500c 12/31 tho 🤣🤣,
YEAH, GO UP YOU FUCKING CUNT!! 😈😈😈,
Might make it tbh. Good luck.,
premarket it hit 464 SPY became bearish and downtrended to a low of 462 bounced off of the 462 strike price, i noticed once it broke this level it gapped up to 463 and then Biden spoke and it creeped up to $466.49, you couldve made your money back. Theta eating that ass boiiiiii but hey you got more money then me lol so i have faith in youuuuuu retard. Hopefully we dont find a covid 2.0 here soon somewhere,
Make sure to dm JPow and ask him to say "printers go brrrrrrr" tomorrow at the senate meeting. JPow's initial [statement](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Powell%20Testimony%2011-30-21.pdf) is up, seems mixed. Maybe tech carries on low volume, I'll play it after we get some channel confirmation. Either way, good luck degen.

Edit: I just looked at futures, rip op...,
That slut only knows how to go down... badumpsh!,
Let me know if that works for I can call my calls bitches,
🤣 Me for the last 2 weeks,
oh it will.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259),
this may work for you but I think spy drops to 464ish,
F,
470c? LMAO try 475c for friday...,
F,
F,
Big Ouch Today Guys. Hoping for a bounce tomorrow.,
u/BagHolding can we see the loss porn?,
I think this is going to work out well for you.,
Patience 🙌 the 1 who goes BRRRRR will save us,
At least you bought cheap,
I’m on this train.  Hope to see ATH by Wednesday!,
rip ur account lol,
GUH,
hope spy wine n dined you before it fucked you like that,
I don’t care what universe you’re from that’s gotta hurt,
I closed. Lost 24k in the process. Until next time retards!,
Hold tight! Watch out for those paper hands.,
As expected…Spy is down below 460. Theta will eat your options unless we get a sharp reversal🙏🏼,
God I love you. <3,
Nothing more entertaining then WSB.... nothing,
I have some bedroom butter you can borrow,
Rip,
F,
F,
I hope everyone here is wrong. Goodluck let’s hope for the opposite of fake news to save you.,
Should be in the green today.,
Sold my calls and with the 7k I had left I bought 15 460p 12/10 and ended up only losing 11k today. Held overnight so we’ll see what open is at,
Ouch.  Sorry dude.,

Is this theory actually true? That low interest rates= growth companies are better? Would explain a lot.,
I know nothing about Asana, but I like the analysis that they’re growing sales at 80% but only IPO’d at 4bil with no reference data, as if growing $50k 80% YoY is the same as growing $1B 80% YoY. Keep on keepin on,
> we see that we've been in a secular decline since the 1980s  
  
That's because in the 1980's we had a president that was ever so slightly more retarded than Joe Biden but far, far, far, far, far, far better liked so when he said *really* dumb shit people didn't start chanting Let's Go Brandon, they said, Well gosh darn it Jimmy, ok. We'll give it a try.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
The only thing you forgot to mention was your crack addiction,
I hope you didn't see your Ford in COVID slump but maybe now..,
FORD by the NUMBERS: 
FORDS Bullish as F GROWTH to the #1 US AUTOMAKER by sales volume:
UNIT SALES in the past 3 Months. 

August 21 - 124,176

September 21 - 157,000 (+26%  +32,824 )

October 21 - 175,918 (+12.1%. +18,918 )

PROJECTED + 8% PER MONTH 

November 21 - 189,992

December 21 - 205,191

January 22 - 222,606

February 22 - 239,335

March 22 - 258,481

April 22 -  279,160

May 22- 301,493

June 22 - 325,612

July 22 - 351,661

August 22 - 379,794

Analysis & Conclusion: 
Ford grew sales at 26% in September and 12.1 % in October. With a projected 8% growth rate month to month for 10 months Ford will have tripled sales and revenue by August 2022 from August 2021. If this were to take place Ford stock would be worth we’ll over $100.00 a share. Keep in mind the 26% growth in September and the 12.1 % in October is constrained by supply shortages. I used a conservative 8% projection to account for future potential supply constraints so I believe numbers are in the ballpark.,
most retarded thing of the day 🏆,
3M average volume with a 20b cap. I’d bite at $69.69 or lower,
This growth therory sounds similar to the the growth therory of General Electric in the 80's or Global Crossing and JDS Uniphase in the late 90's.  Rise, wash, repeat ya dumb Ape,
you had me at   


>"Those make my pp extra hard",
So, buy ford calls?,

Hey /u/illemonati427, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
That means we have 3-4 extra month for the bull to run. 

All in 10x leverage QQQ,
This is the most retarded shit I’ve read in awhile… why does it actually make sense,
Nostradumbass,
The answer to your question is C) All of the above,
> the bull run can't continue forever

i've heard this line for the last couple of years,
You're sofa king retarded.

Beijing Summer = Crash.

Winter is opposite of summer...

Beijing Winter = MOON

Load up on calls before you miss the rocket.![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
Winter Olympics don't count,
yes when China turned out the lights of the 2008 Olympics' Birds Nest Stadium - the 'Great Recession' came on - it already had beginnings here in the states, but many thought China would stay strong enough to give a soft landing - didn't happen.,
>the bull run can't continue forever

The bull run stops when Jpow says so. If he dies (assuming he's mortal) before saying so, it will continue forever.,
Thats like trying to find a pattern where none existed before. A common human mind issue, since people have a need to find a cause/effect correlation even when none exists 🤷🏽‍♂️

More than likely, a stock market event will occur when a flash mob event happens.,
I stopping trying to make money in American markets as a bear long ago.  If you want to profit as a bear its China if you dare.,
Jokes on you, jpow go brrrrr,
I believe the saying is "correlation is not the same as causation"

But on the off chance it's sarcasm and I'm just a tool, I don't want to end up in r/whoosh so I choose option b!,
How did they get the olympics again?

I guess nobody else wants it with covid.,
We need a countdown clock ⏰,
God damn this is incredibly autistic,
Tin-fucking-foil,
Take it to the Beautiful Mind wood shed out back,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
"The market is overinflated right now, the bull run can't continue forever"

The fuck it is, and the fuck it can't.,
No lol,
Personally I try to see if some country is trying to build one of em tallest buildings or towers. [Sky Scraper Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper_Index) have historically gone up before economic crashes.,
China will trade sideways for a few thousand years. Buying January 4575 calls now,
After the disgraceful summer Olympics in Tokyo who even cares about the winter crap.,
I would say autistic but no positions have been posted and they can be smart at times, I'd say this one has downs,
Instructions unclear, Told my girlfriend to fuck off and now I'm with her boyfriend.,
>Does the Olympics being held in Bejing causes markets to crash  
>  
>Or does the overinflation of the markets cause the Bejing Olympics?

Neither.

The PLA invading Taiwan causes markets to crash.  Which may or may not involve them also attacking military bases in Japan, Okinawa, Guam and possibly even Australia and Hawaii as well as knocking out satellites.  Oh if it were to get really dicey possibly launching EMPs over the US mainland as well. 

That or a giant earthquake.,
Russia took over Crimea after the Sochi Winter olympics.  Russia is massing troops at the ukraine border right now as well.    


If china wants to maintain precedent, they could invade Taiwan after the Beijing olympics, bringing the markets to a screeching halt.  I didn't think another world war would ever occur but China is doing some really shady shit.,
Stop stealing my fucking ideas! Lol, but seriously said this like last month. Here’s my logic: there’s an avalanche of default and business failures over there (housing) and thus a china economic recession incoming. They’ll hold it together until after the olympics have passed to save face but come march shit will implode. Ive said it before, but here it is: March 2022 will be the new March 2020.,
China is always the problem.,
Good old China experiment!,
The Jamaican bobsled team will crash harder,
So... Feb '22 SPY 300p??,
This is the same logical fallacy as what happens in numerology. Skip all the intricate, multi-dimensional factors around a highly complex process and just say, “Some 8’s we’re involved on this day and now we have some 8’s coming again.”,
many people are predicting a correction soon

Yes. Did they ever stop?,
More convincing analysis than 95% of the other “here’s why a downturn is coming” posts,
Come on, this is spurious correlation.,
gtfo of here you gay bear,
Nobody knows the duration of a bull market. Nobody knows the duration of a bear market. Anyone who says they do based on X, Y, or Z is just as clueless as the rest of us.,

Lol, invested in hood, on hood, hahahaha,
28 percent, chill  
  
Come back when it’s 99% down,
#have u tried sticking a carrot up your anus?,
You’re doing just fine.  Keep it up.  🤦🏻,
Wow, you hate money and love getting fucked huh?,
Put another $20k in and post screen shots in 3 months,
What made you think that investing into this pos was a good idea?,
Sorry, I just can't feel sorry for you.,
Is this r/leopardsatemyface?!

Sell covered calls and fuck Cohen and the Mets.,
Not investing in scams is a good way to preserve wealth.,
Clown.,
One question; WHY? Can’t feel sorry for you dude. You invested in RH. Only way I’d throw money at RH is to buy Puts, and take delight in watching it fall and wreck Vlad.,
Sell CC’s,
Aww man, that's tough luck! It's hard to send help to the hood... It's just not safe.,
Lol wtf is this, loss porn for ants?,
Your fucked buddy,
Shit stock 

Shit brokerage




Ditch both imo.,
Uh, just buy the dip or whatever,
HOOD it’s in an itsy bitsy gully. It’s just a gully that’s all. Nerves .,
Welcome to the club,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
You should have bought at $84 so it would’ve kept going up since you gave it some buying pressure,
What is this, loss porn for ants?!,
We're all super glad this happened to you xD,
Lmao you invested in hood after the shit they pulled. You know they have no future right. Like nothing is washing that big black mark against them off,
You a true retard for dumping your money in this pos company...... fuck robinhood,
At least you are average at 36. I am average at 45! Selling covered calls but will take forever to break even.,
HAHAHA! Did yoy really?😆 Best I've seen in a long time...cut your losses,
Don’t worry, can’t go tits up,
fool me once....,
I mean you’re definitely a huge idiot,
Getting fucked by your own abuser, huh? You're the apest ape. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
I vote that “guh” be reserved for losses greater than 80%,
Buy the dip. Inverse wsb. 🤝,
Hahahahaha you deserved this,
Share lock up ends 11/30, will dump further. May want to take the L and get out,
That's what you fukn get,
get some HJ money behind wendys and average down,
Inverse the sub. Majority of people are bearish.

This is the only way. REMEMBER.

They called DFV retarded. 

Let’s gooo,
No pity for supporting the shit that fucked us in Jan. So FUCK YOU OP. Burn with the rest of Robbinghood and Shitadel. 💩💩💩,
I don’t know what’s worse, investing in HOOD pr coming on here to whine about your loss,
I can’t wait till you lose more. Moron buying hood,
Only thing dumber than buying HOOD is buying HOOD on RH.,
Going long on HOOD, that's impressively retarded even by WSB standards. This guy should be a mod.,
🤫 it can hear you,
 Trading hood and using hood graph
Sound like shill to me 
Fake ass,
I feel your pain, I’m in at 45 😂,
F,
Sending thot and players,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I own piece of the pie,
Selling cc's to other retards yet?,
Atleast you got shares, Cathie will buy em off you if you really wanna sell,
Just turn off the sell button LULZ,
In life we have to make decisions sometimes they are the wrong the choice and you lose.  It’s okay to lose if you learn from it.  So fail often but fail quickly cut your losses and invest in something that you research better next time.,
Sell stock, change brokerage.,
You came to the wrong HOOD boy,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
Your problem is in the “Portfolio Diversity” column.,
Lol, that’s what you get. No help for you. 

Sell now, ask questions later. 

I would also buy GME now and research later.,
Cathie Wood is buying so it is going down 🤔🤔,
This post seems to trollish. How do you follow this sub or any other sub on Reddit and throw 18k into hood. It's either that or your parents have deep pockets.,
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes! Should have bought puts on hood,
Just ask them to take your money and give you a CB 10x what you paid. 

They good for it!,
Down 28% is nothing lol,
30% down is not bad my dude,
https://c.tenor.com/N80FMoPU4r0AAAAC/what-were-you-thinking.gif,
Only -28%? Weak shit. Gotta pump those numbers up.,
Sorry, not sorry...,
The market is mooning why are you investing in hood😂,
WCGW: Went in Hood, stayed in the Hood, and got rob by the Hood.,
Take your money out of $hood and plow it into $lcid. You'll make your money back. Also, options on the stock are cheap.,
Just sell it, take the loss, then buy puts, you'll be back in the green in like a week,
bro you really though hood was a good investment help yourself,
Hood turned off profits. This shit company needs to go to 0.,
You deserve it :),
Get absolutely fckin REKT kid. This is chump change,
Probably see a psychiatrist for help,
stop investing in bullshit stocks - have you ever heard of Microsoft?,
We’re gonna need a bigger $ROPE,
You gotta be kidding, i thought we were joking when we said we were pushing random button on robinhood ui,
Bet against it with what you have left.,
The help is under the “hood”,
Now this guy retards. Serves you right for getting into Robinhood.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
Hell yeah, my puts printed!,
Guh,
Anyone who invests in the boy from Bulgaria deserves this.,
I send my condolences with my -80% position on Workhorse im currently sustaining 🤦‍♂️,
HOOD got circumcised.,
Send help, this is what we all wanted and predicted to happen.,
sell before you get to 30,
You did this to yourself,
Give this retard a cookie,
It’s okay just turn it off and back on again it should work,
Shares, so you're fine (but its also HOOD so maybe not),
Your WISH is on it's way. Or more like your on your way to becoming Wish. 😎,
looks like hood is boutta put you in the 'hood',
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
What moron invests in an entry level broker months after the largest influx of new retail traders in history and thinks it's going to maintain it's growth? When Robinhood told you they were gaining about a million members a month did you seriously think that was sustainable? I'd bet 50% of them left trading within a month, and I'd bet 30% of the ones that still use the app invest lest than $200. My guy you bought in at the absolute peak of Robinhood lol.,
omg, this can't be helped,
Instead of posting this you should have been selling.,
Holy fuck… degenerate retards buying this crap on the fucking RH app to wow speechless man …you truly belong here. See you behind Wendy’s dude,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Well, at least you didn't go all in on HOOD like that guy yesterday.,
That number under these words „Portfolio diversity“ is way too low, that’s my advice for you,
Are all your portfolio shares in HOOD?,
Take the lost, invest into something else maybe. All analysis are knocking the company down. Hood has a lot of clients, but most have small money, unlike Schwab or TD. Than again, if you sell it, it will start going up. Lol,
Haha,
On the positive side, you phone battery has plenty of juice!,
Lookup expiration coming, embrace for 16-18 dollar price,
I don’t think you are going to get much sympathy on this sub with this trade.,
Don't worry, bro, got your back sending in a MOASS, never mind, there is no buy button... guess the hedgies will get turns to use ur back side ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Probably shorted their own stock. Will buy back low, and release news for a run while shutting off the sell button,
dude, it will go up, trust me bro,
Deserved.,
What happens in the hood stays in the hood, you basically shot yourself.,
Did your mother drop you? Or was it her boyfriend?,
Eat shit Vlad you cunt!,
Buy and hold diamond hands prog fam💎💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🙌,
You’re not even down 50%. Chill the fuck out. Once you legit consider working behind Wendy’s, then you need help.,
Ahahahahahhahahah,
What an ass whipping.,
What would compel you to make this investment,
Delete the app clear cache and re install. 

Should set you back up with the game’s 18k starter fund your character started with. Just make sure to save regularly this time so you can save scum if you make a mistake again.,
My help arrives in the form of hindsight.

 You should not have bought those stocks. 

Godspeed.,
At least do something funny if you're dying to burn up money.

take out 0dte options that are 50% away from the current price or something.,
Ok. Exit your RH positions, it's a shit company. Not financial advice, just the help you asked for.,
Robinhood: taking from the retarded and giving to the rich,
Move is to Buy bmtx and nxrp and make hella money!! 🚀🚀,
Im way more comfortable holding WISH than this crap,
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m sorry bud you’re on your own in this one,
This is peak retardation that I am here for,
11% of your portfolio, rookie numbers for wsb. Come back When its 100%.,
REEEEEEEEEEEE,
I’m glad u lost money investing in that trash stock fuck robinhood,
Bro im long viac shut the fuck up.,
Sell shares, buy puts. This thing will be tanking hard next earnings when they miss on whatever user growth metrics they overpromised on.,
You’re the retard who invested in robinhood,
Let's play Get Help! 😀,
Thinking HOOD was a good play is on par with the retards that think DWAC is going to moon because a serial bankrupter became attached to it.,
You invested in Robinhood…you’re on your own on this one homie,
Try r/Autism for the help you’re looking for,
Investor: buys stonks using RH and lose <28%
This investor 2: Buys RH stonk and lose >28%!,
Wait I think you screwed up and bought shares, you were suppose to short HOOD,
I got assigned to this piece of shit too, it was stagnant for months and as soon as I sell puts it crashed 🤡,
We do not help people that don't want to help themselves. What were you thinking OP?,
Have you tried customer support? Looks like an issue they might be able to help. Its internal matter anyhow,
Thief stock,
Lol,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Your biggest mistake was trusting robinghood,
28% loss ain't real pain boy,
That's cute 🤣,
I bought, it went up, it went down, I sold with just above my cost. We all knew it would drop but you clearly bought at the wrong time,
Keep buying the dip and sell at the bottom.,
Invested in a shit company, what did you expect?,
What the fuck is this weak ass shit??? -5k unrealized…. I lost that my first month. REALIZED,
And im gonna keep shorting it, why? Cuz fuk em thats why.,
I’m sorry, but you deserve to hold the bag on this one.,
Are you fucking retarded? Or just plain stupid, using the company app to buy company house stock hahaha,
Stoplosses,
Sell calls against them till eternity 😩😩,
What’s driving the down action? Cathy sold off her position?,
Why would you invest in a criminal scam company. They literally spam email you to update your tax status so you open app to pad statistics.  Their userbase is dead and image forever tarnished,
Honestly if you went long on Hood you deserve this,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Sell,
Oh, u in da hood? U fkd!,
You were stupid enough to invest in that scam. You deserve this.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
HOOD gon love it,
You are an actual retarded retard,
If Robinhood had the ability to roll options I might use them more. The only good thing they got is 2.5% interest rate on margin. It would also be nice to have my order book not be a big advertisement for " Introducing Cash Management". Oh and the red and green themes depending on if my portfolio is up or down for the day off very annoying.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
If its not zero youre in it to win it,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)

At least it's shares, opinion em,
Is your other holding WISH? This makes total sense.,
Same here (I am just trying to decrease my cost basis by buying the dip everyday):

https://imgur.com/2gqkGEg,
Bro stop being poor. Just close your eyes,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Bruh it’s down 30% and it’s barely 11% of your portfolio. What is this, a loss for ants?,
I am on the same boat,

Time for you to close other winners and average down, 

ARK have been buying the dip. 

It will bounce,
Right there with you bro, the stock is overly hated,
Please answer me op please.
Why did you buy the stock of a company that scammed a good part of it's customers by shutting. Of the buy button. In Jan.? That killed a teenager because they showed him false losses and didnt offer customer support and lastly insider traded the verry stocks they later made sell only.

Not gonna talk about them doing it for their big daddy Citadel since.... Eventhough the proof was there the oh so fair court said they are innocent.,
You deserved this ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Who’s p p do i gotta suck to get a $1,000 loan?,
Cut your losses, I did.,
You bought into RH???? Your fault,
DID THEY HELP WHEN WE ASKED WITH GAMESTOP?,
Best puts ever made,
You bet on our mortal enemy?,
Ugh... Seriously tho.. 2000+ companies to invest in and you choose RH to "all in" yikes my man... 
Maybe when they release the "Crypto Wallet" you can get some profits.. if they don't... You know.. start screwing it up.. 
Crypto is even harder to wrangle than Stocks.,
It ain’t all good in the hood,
Buying hood on hood only to have hood fuck you. Peak retard,
I thought we were supposed to buy PUTS,
Main thing I took from this is that ppl still use Viber, apparently,
Did Woods convince you to buy?,
Cant have shit in Detroit,
What a moron.  
Your still holding, we all sold when it was above $50

Bag holder![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),
You should invest into $ROPE.. here ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) the first share is on me,
You didn't apply the 10% stop loss!?!?,
Hopefully Robinhood goes out of business,
Dum ass,
Covered calls even then since you're selling opposite direction of price movement, premiums for low delta are probably pennies,
I’m supposed to give a fuck about 5 grand?,
You reap what you sow.,
You invested into the most hated brokerage of all time. You deserve this.,
mf you sucking dick tonight.,
Your doin fine… pls continue,

For context this greedy 🐻🌈 was up %200 on very OTM 400 puts last Friday .. but instead of selling he decide to hold.,
Take your 8k and run you fucking gay ass bear,
At least you're still up 8k. I want to see the idiot that bought 80k in puts EOD Friday.,
Never bet against spy ever, or tesla.,
Harsh! Sorry brother RIP unless Africa has a crazy mutation of Covid 19 or Godzilla comes out of the ocean again I don’t SPY with my little eye this thing going to 400 anytime soon.  

Who else is on the call train? ATH anyone by Wednesday?,
Never fight the fed,
Mild [gains](https://imgur.com/CjANuEh.png)  
Bought this morning.  
I was going to sell puts to buy more calls too but chickened out. (How to lose all monies in two hours.),

Delusion at its finest!,

There is still time to buy knee pads to help you at your new job behind the wendy's,
Move is to Buy bmtx and nxrp and make hella money!! 🚀🚀,
You deserve it my friend.,

Dumb ass,
Hope you closed today cause the rest of this week might not be pretty for you…,

This mf looks exactly like someone who'd say some speculative BS to boost his stock,
No conflict of interest to see here folks,
Duh, of course it will.. time to make a 4th booster!,
No kidding. The guy who sells vaccines hinting at selling another vaccine. Who still falls for this shit?,
How much has their stock increased since 2019 again?,
These assholes maybe opening a champagne 🍾 whenever there’s a news of new variant,
Someone get this fuckin CEO an @Jack pill,
The news said we don’t know how the current vaccine is against omicron, but then say get your booster. Why?,

And this is why COVAXIN will finally get EUA,

Well there will be many boosters. Yearly like the common flu. It won’t end because we all know it will mutate. That’s why it is called Vaccination and not Immunization.,

Wait until they study it and it will be exactly like the delta variant. Remember the first weeks with delta variant? Same scenario. By all means, we should protect ourselves, but not to react like children and throw tantrums each time something is happening. Oh, fuck, stock market is like a kindergarten... nvm.,
Yea gonna need a 5th booster for the next made up strain too, but dont worry the shots are fReE,

The vaccines have struggled with covid, because the y don't work.,
People acting like this guy makes money from vaccines. HE DOESN'T! People acting like Moderna has an interest in people getting vaccine shots... THEY DON'T! They are doing this from the **goodness of their hearts for the good of humanity** you damn apes. This is the most LETHAL virus known to man.  If you don't get the shot you are as good as dead.,

Yeah...who needs natural immunity...cha-ching...,
The good news is that 10 other things will be effective against it and doctors will quietly prescribe them, like they've done throughout this pandemic.

The bad news is that Pfizer will pay CNN to call them illegal horsepaste and your crazy aunt will fall for it .

Basically just cringe through this and don't let it affect your investment decisions at all. It might even be a good thing that these artificially induced false-alarm pullbacks have stalled a real/inevitable bubble burst.,
The thing they should lead with is:. NO HOSPITALIZATIONS OR DEATHS FROM OMICRON.  That's the key ingredient the fuckface media aren't sprinkling down their shitty elbow.,

How do AUR trucks stop and fill up gas on a long haul/charge.,
this is the only WSB stock in my portfolio of 22 that is green currently,
I have some above-average insight into this game (SF tech guy with connections to lots of self-driving company employees and ex-employees.  Also worked at Uber prior of sale of ATG to aurora).  Pretty bearish on self-driving truck companies in the short term.   These low-revenue companies will correct hard, and revenue is going to be very slow growing for the next few coming years.  Aurora and Embark both SPAC'd too, so thats not too hot either.,
WSB seems more autistic than normal this morning,
There is no trucker shortage. Fake news. Those containers in the ocean and Long Beach. Management told their people back in April not to ask questions when asked why they couldn't break down the containers and get tge stuff out. All BS by the govt for whatever stupid reason,
Self driving trucks have a limited application. Yes, that’s right kiddo. One size does not fit all. While self driving f trucks could work on the expressways / long haul or a blocked off / specifically built truck yard, human interaction/ control is and will be required.,
ACB,
Truckers dont just drive, they often also fill and load out the trucks. This way there would be needed another person doing that replacing the driver which would not solve anything,

Tagged nsfw cause of the steaming load you busted on your monitor im assuming?,
Riip,
You're an absolute retard.

Hopefully you use some of that to upsize your fries tonight.,
Rug pull when?,
This doesn't really show gains though,
😵‍💫,
better sell it now before drop wipe out!,
Definitely diamond balls,
Kind of curious as to how you pulled this off considering it closed $2 under what it opened at. Did you already have these? If so, why?,
you're splitting hairs over a $200 portfolio, aren't you,
Got some backtests? Curious to see how much of a difference the volitility decay actually makes (and whether it's worth the extra expense and effort),
You check out r/letfs?,

I will very glad if the stock price go up soon…..or my options will expire worthless. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
It’s not worth $19 or $15 or $8…. But at $3.5? It’s definitely a steal.. may not  be for options.. perfect entry point to buyin and add more when the company starts improving and the regulations stabilise..,
I bought in 5000 shares at $4.7 and I'm now bag holding...only took 2 weeks for like -20% lol,
The headwinds will hurt growth for a while but they will go away eventually. The company being cash flow positive and paying down debt is key for me.

I have 1400 shares with an average just below $5/sh. I plan on adding until I get to about 2000 shares as long as it stays below $4/sh.,
"long term" = share price will continue to decline and I will continue to lose money,
hello fellow bagholder,
I am 75% down from SPAC days. Good thing I don’t have too many and somehow I don’t feel like averaging down.,
“Finished-tech” Paysafe is terrible and surely on a free-fall to zero.,
The company punted on this year and the next nah son,
People are *STILL* pumping this stock here?  I remember when people were pumping it in the 10-12 range, lol.,
They already waved the white flag on 2022, essentially scrapped the wallet as useless in terms of value.  It can go lower, and should.

What are your positions?,

“Luckily” space x and Tesla are two separate companies.  Tesla bulls would skyrocket the price of the stock if space x was included.  

It’s disturbing news generally, but shouldn’t have much effect on the stock price in a sane market… not that anything about our current market follows sane guidelines.,
Maybe that was the real reason he decided to sell billions worth of Tesla. A Twitter poll seemed kinda wild but could’ve been a cover,
No,
I’ve said this before, but even IF SpaceX has money issues, I feel like EVERYONE would buy it given the chance. After all, they’re still the second most valuable private company in the world.,
You should probably delete this,
sure. buy puts. then hope that musk won’t make tesla a holding incl. spacex, starlink and pi phone, which will bring the stock mid-term to $3000, as cathie wood predicted. is your hope a good strategy?,
I bought shares five minutes ago…,
Two very separate entities,
If SpaceX needs money, Elon is definitely selling if its his last resort. 

Which means he will sell Tesla stock, would that impact  tesla price? No not really,
It's very, very difficult to trade puts on TSLA... Got burned so many times.,
It won't go down before 12.9

If you insist, buy PUTS expire after 12.9,
Boy, the mods will just let anything in these days huh?,
Tesla will probably drop anyway I’d say go for it,
SpaceX is actually some sort of marketing for Tesla. Everyone bets on Elon for being this genius with rockets if it fails yeah it will tank.,
1) Musk has been a forced seller to pay taxes, TSLA has stayed near ath’s
2) ARK had been selling to rebalance, TSLA stronk
3) Market has been selling and TSLA has held up

Read the room u fuck this shit is gonna go up my god, all these sellers and thing doesnt go down = next direction up,
What’s this got to do with Tesla?,
I am just curious if SpaceX goes down, it could drag tesla with it, right? Or am I too dumb for this?,

SPY TO 500 BY 12/31. 

BTW I love these posts. Thanks man,
Solid DD, holding SPY 3/18 500 x30.,
Great post as always, thank you for this.,
Can someone explain his positions to me curious one is red and one is green they both look like Disney calls though?,
Too many word. What mean?,
Thx Bro!,
listen to Miz Yellen....,
SPY nerds are missing out on the QQQ to 420.69 EOM,
Thanks for the read, bought some Jan 480 calls this morning, felt good about them.,
I can’t see a green week if there’s not a deficit deal at least proposed but I’m working on inversing myself so calls all around once IV dies down,
Are you smallchimpu?,
Anyone know a good book or site to help me understand TA?,
What a fucking assimetric graph!

Bullish on 471 but bearish on 458? What kind of targeting is that? How come the upside is way higher then the downside? Sorry for reading fast,

Fear is man's greatest curse.,
Korea creamed, China & Japan straddled... hope you Muricans overcome Omicron FUD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Honestly,
theres 2 ways to play this.  
short term puts on overvalued trash, otherwise keep cash and wait until market gets a direction.  

last week was kinda choppy and we have 1 friday of bear and monday of half bear and you guys forgot the 2 weeks of greens?,
This is the silliest timeline 😂,
Oh my god…2.5%….we are all fucked,
I just forgot about covid for a moment and opened the link to see what korean company was this called Omicron,
Who is Korea?,

Something odd about this screenshot. Heh..,
The only place in your photo that is any hint of yellow...,
fake and gay. mods please verify and ban if truly fake.,
The text under the ticker is yellow for “paperMoney” and live trading accounts in TOS. If the OP provided a screenshot of the entire app it would be easier to assume if it’s real or fake. The active icon color on a paperMoney account in TOS is yellow, and in a live trading account it’s green. So when viewing the “Positions” screen, the briefcase would be green if logged into a live trading account.,
Does yellow on TDA mean paper trading?,
I like to go into TD paper trading and click the “add money” button too. Helps on the red days.,
Why is the yellow TESLA font bigger than the MODERNA one?

Also how is P/L Open 0 for all of them (curious)

 lol idk it looks fake to me. But if it's real, congrats.,
The battery really drained the fuck out while getting you the gains. Cool. 😄,
Can I ask you this? Do you have tda account? If you do please log in into fake account and real. Then trade then come back here we can talk more. Don’t say something you don’t know haha,

You can time it wrong apparently,
\+17640 added to your social credit,
looks like the market timed you,
CCP thanks you for your donation,
Xi sends his regards!!!!!,
No YOU can’t time the market,
China stocks...,
If your strategy was to time the market for a loss, you did a great job!,
at this point I think BABA can go to $30, and if you think I'll keep buying the motherfucking dip every week you're goddamn right,
I seem to time it incorrectly EVERY time?!,
To be fair, now BABA looks like a buy.,
don't worry man it's the bottom now again...,
Funny thing is that this is gonna a pretty big gain if OP can hold,
I will buy a long call on BABA when the stock price drop to $110.,
Red like Communism. 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳,
If Charlie Munger is holding you probably should too. Time to test those hands.,
I’m not sure what the problem is. You have shares. They won’t expire worthless. You didn’t sell to realize the loss.

Just hold those bags til they fill up with money instead of losses.,
Investing in Chinese companies is like putting your balls in a vice... There is absolutely NOTHING to suggest that things are ever going to get better or sentiment will change. The CCP literally made it their mission to fuck over all companies listed overseas and trash them day in and day out... FFS they abducted the fucking CEO of the company.. These fucker do not care about stock holders - never touching a chinese company again. They can fuck off - trust is gone.,
You timed it. Maybe didn't make an ideal trade to make money but still impressive timing. We have to enjoy the things we do well.,
holy shit.. this stock goes down almost everyday

glad i never bought in past. altho selling otm puts at this level looks enticing,
You’re lucky I just cut lost today and I lost 380k on baba . I bought it at 226 and keep average down today I finally cut it fuck this.,
Commie 🤡🤡🤡,
.,
-$17,640,
AI - Alibaba Intelligence,
Best advice I have heard thus far,
I just lost my perhaps biggest client because of that trade, soo yeah... I feel you.,
Best time to buy is when everyone says it sucks...looks like time to buy.,
Buying calls tomorow,
i regret buying,
since when is 16% a loss porn? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),
no....YOU can't tike the market lol,

After holding $RKLB for a month which barely moved I sold them all and bought $DASH puts, turns out to be the biggest retune on one single ticker I’ve ever had.,
I have no idea how to read this,
Too many numbers. Do you have a picture book version?,
Fuck yes. Congrats.,
You should invest it all in Rocket lab now,
So you have 100 contracts?,
on door dash ? smh,
Hope you cashed in them chips. Nice gain 👍,
I thought "gamble" meant there was a slight chance you could win something?,
12/17 DASH $200 PUTS x 100 contracts @ 5.00

BID Closed at 20.25 yesterday 11/29.,

TSLA: the unlimited money glitch,
I've got 30 shares, but my average cost is around $900 heheh,
Been buying on dips and selling on rips for a.littlemwhile now in an IRA and it has been awesome, holding with you in a cash account.,
LONG TERM PROFITS 📈,
Am I the only retard that's still holding Tesla calls and somehow losing money?,
Buy more!  That average price is so low,

Hey /u/prettyboyv, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
I held this bitch for 6 months and it didnt do squat.  Immediate brrrrrr like a week after selling.

You're welcome.,
Positions: 250 GOEV shares.,
Jan21 $25c

Will WSB still hate GOEV when it’s made us all rich?,
bought shares when it was a spac. 

GOEV🚀,
Have loved this company since I read about it in Mid-2020, invested pre-SPAC and have held through the good times and bad.  High risk, but is making all the right moves.  Just made 3B market cap but, in my opinion, is no where near where it could/should/will be.  No other company is re-inventing the car like this one and I'm down for it.

This thing has the potential to explode if people get their hands on the vehicles and love them, they are like nothing else on the road at the moment and could revolutionize the industry (or, at a minimum, be a successful company that's a strong alternative to everything else on the road).,
I'm in Canoo since May, no regrets no worries no stress.
9 months from now I'm cashing out and be loaded =),
Tony will bring you riches if you believe hard enough,
Polestar...you're looking for Polestar if you want a stock that meets your titles description,
If I’m going to take a real crap shot at a EV right now it’s with Fisker. But I do like Canoo.,
Im in!,
All these bullshit green cars need a shit ton of mining (open pit mining hence why I call them bullshit), and miners are historically cheap. I’m buying miners. Dumb leftist Govts will force this “revolution” (stupidity) so I expect miners to do better next year as industrial demand is what push price around (investor demand not as much). Also buying oil companies as a hedge against the “green” narrative. Capitalize on leftist stupidity, it’s providing a plethora of opportunities like this.,
Canoo's cars look like what cars with downsyndrome look like.,
Tesla is the next Tesla.,
So the CEO "founded and sold" other companies in his past? So he basically pumped and dumped his own shit. That's not what you want to hear from someone that is in charge of an EV startup with no product on the road and already at a crazy valuation for no fucking reason,
Serial entrepreneur is rarely a good thing.
OK is a dogshit place to put a plant. People there think earthquakes come from the windmills, and make all their money from oil/gas. They won't be able to recruit the brains, and the labor they would need for production gets better pay from fossil industries. Middle of nowhere, slow/heavy factor input shipping costs in and out.
Ford has been pushing the skateboard platform since like 2010. That's Tesla's basis, their specs are better, and the cars/trucks don't look like a rolling choad. It's not innovative.
Solid retard play, 6/10.,
Have too much money? Wanna live a monastic lifestyle? Take an oath of poverty? GOEV might be for you.,
TLDR: don’t buy GOEV,
GOEV keeps floundering.  My money is on polestar, they have vehicles / sales / service network,
Anyone notice how all the GOEV bagholders need to contribute countless DD's and pitches over this stock....

&#x200B;

While all the EVGO holders are silent and happy? :D 

If WSB has taught me one thing... its that all the stocks that get peddled on here are all shit stocks. You never hear about the good ones because people dont need help unloading bags.,
Tesla Baby. All these lame ripoffs will fold like all the rest did,
Hi, I'm not very familiar with papers or r wallstreetbets, but what do you guys think about Samsung ?
Should I by some ? They could rise, because Christmas,
Tony aquila is a toxic scumbag of a leader that treats employees like shit and lies directly to his board and investors. But don't take my word for it look how bad he fucked audatex.  Serial narcissist is a more accurate title.,
How about put money into soxl

3x ETF,
I may work for a company that supplies parts to all the EV companies including Tesla. Faraday can’t pay us and Rivian barely has prototype tooling. Canoo, or EVelozity or whatever their first name was, is a total shitshow to work with and their engineers are jumping ship just like faraday and the others for real car companies. Canoo also stole designs and making prototypes in China, their quality sucks, and any forecast we see from them is so outrageous they must have smoked crack to come up with the start of production and ramp up. At this point they just lie to try and get bargaining power and to sucker in more companies to help design for free and supply them parts.

Do not bet the farm on canoo. Fuck subscription model for a car, they gonna get like gay inner city urbanite professionals with poodles that don’t want to own a car? I mean wtf,
That's called *a frame* and is a more expensive not less expensive way to build a car.,
Wtf are all these paragraphs?! You’re retarded but hide it pretty good 👍,
Skate or die,
You’ve made a compelling case. I’ve gone all in. Let’s goooooo 🚀,
It would be much smarter to go with the undervalued PTRA which is already producing vehicles.,
“The CEO is good”….you forgot to mention that Tony Tequila never graduated high school.,
Seems dumb to buy into a stock that's up 60 percent in last month. People missed ride and safe ish buy price. Funny wsb always pumps stocks that are already at there top. " if your reading about it it's usually to late " you guys remind me of mosquitoes endlessly flying into the same bug zapper. I love the light show carry on.,
Ugly rides..,
BYD Is a amuch better bet,

And that was just from one contract too. Wow. Congrats on the gains,
Imagine if you had balls and threw some real money on it,
howd you know about the new variant before the news?,
People are too excited for moderna. Nothing fundamentally changed with company and that one trick pony vaccine. Take your gains 👍,
No way did I expect that to keep climbing today.  The rest of the market rebounded because the new COVID variant isn’t as bad as people feared on Friday. MRNA should have pulled back and lost half of its Friday gains.,
Now you can turn your small teddies into big teddies 🍈,
Do you think it continues to rise?,
I really, really wish I understood calls (and how to do them on Etrade). I already have a bad gambling addiction but this looks right up my alley.,
what contract did you buy and when? you did sell right?,
Loss porn is great...but I also like seeing gain porn, even if it ain't mine.  Congrats!  Now sell 1/2!,
I have the same thing lol,
Should’ve bought a hundred,
Might be a dumb question but what app is this that everyone uses to trade?,
How do you get that much %? I am retarded,

You gotta give the people what they want, and the people want Doc Ock,
I tried for 45 minutes yesterday to get tickets with the websites and apps crashing and finally said fuck it.  Went on about an hour ago and was able to get tickets without any trouble for the 18th,
But, but, African COVID!!!,
More likely to benefit CNK, Sony, and to an extent DIS as AMC isn't trading on fundamentals.,
Thanks for reminding me to get mine.,
Got mine for Friday morning @ an AMC Prime!,

This is a meme, not DD. Please change flair. Thank you.,
God damn that link to the episode really shows you who's watching cable these days. She's speaking so slowly a 5 year old could follow along and for every minute of content there's 3 minutes of pharmaceutical ads,
Don't abuse the flair. This isn't DD.,

Ya'll got any more of those blackberry stonks?,

I thought futes are bright green.,
$BB for the rip 👀🍇,
Ok retard,
You know what to do with you puts - JPow,
I bought Friday and no dip as of yet for TSLA...,
Thinking about going Yolo on some Intel medium term /leaps. Heading back to upper 50's IMO. I'll stream the porn for all to see in March.,
So what are we loading up on?,

My past "investing" (gambling) history was nothing but pure mistakes   
that made me wonder what I was doing with my life. Out of desperation to  
 recover, I made a huge idiotic play and Yolo'd everything on AMD that   
somehow managed to save my entire portfolio. Don't be like me, risk what  
 able to lose without going into depression.,
I have 400 shares or AMD from 80-110s… who knew I’d be feeling that I didn’t get enough a few months later lol,
Bro up $5 for the entire year. Sheeesh. Couldve got a better return at my pawn shop,
RIP homie,
Honestly dude if I were you I would put more efforts in looking for a better pay job instead of stock market if all i can yolo is 12k, it’s not worth the time and stress.,

Go two aisles over and buy the dip,
 u/TheEmperorOfJenks aka The Gourdfather would say avoid them at all cost.,
Bro, wait until you hear more on the shipment coming in from Argentina,
Wait. You’ll get squashed if you buy in now.,
You fool! The South American cargo ship is en route! Put put puts!,
You’re supposed to haggle,
My sandwich based portfolio was down 98% within the first 6 days. Whooop whoop whoop whoop whoop.,
I have no idea why this is the top post on WSB but god bless you retards. I took this picture randomly at the grocery store because "LOL GOURD FUTURES" when I saw the sign - didn't think it would command this level of attention. But hey, I'll take my 5 seconds of being the top post on the subreddit with the most intelligent people on the planet!

Also, all of my passwords now contain the phrase "gourd futures" in one way or another. Come at me, hackerman!,
actually we’re looking for a 2.36 resistance level, 2.48 is to be bought out by REE FUNDS, HODL BROTHER,
[They have been going up the whole month of November! I got a feeling they are gonna peak right around... January.](https://youtu.be/kDM0GLVTj_k),
Fucking love WinCo,
You're paying way too much for gourds. Who's your gourd guy?,
Are there "non" ornamental gourds?  Like specific purposes or practical gourds?,
Winco FTW.,
Oh my gourd….,
Holy shit people actually do shop at Grocery Outlet, despite the YTD performance of $GO

Edit - wait this is Winco or similar,
Oversold,
Wynco?,
I kept telling you that you gotta sell your pumpkin futures **before** Halloween!,
Don't buy the gourd... Buy the packet of seeds and there's a chance you'll have a 50x by this time next year,
Let’s not forget the guy who shorted all of South Africa. He must be rich.,
Homer you idiot, you're supposed to sell your pumpkin futures *before* Halloween, before!,
A classic,
Nah, wait for the dip.,
The canal is fine. It’s early but watermelons will be all the rage next summer.,
Don't do it, it's just that other guy offloading his bags.,
limit order $2.50 for 1000 shares, stop loss at $2.00 and limit sell at $1000.  My plan for Monday $Gourd,
DD is super bullish on Gourd Futures. buy now and skip the FOMO.,
Do it! Ornamental gourd sales were skyrocketing all of September and October. When we get the November numbers in, I expect them to be even higher. My technical analysis is indicating 400% yearly growth from here.,
Used to work at a farm stand.  This is actually an astronomically high gourd price.  Surprising as they shouldn’t be oversold right now… I’d wait for a better entrance.,
I can’t remember gourdkings username but if you kept following the saga afterwards it just kept getting more ridiculous. He asked for recipes to cook the gourds he was stuck with. He tried to invest in precious metals and ordered some fake platinum from some sketchy Eastern European website. Then he had a post about getting sick from gas station sushi. Next post he was moving to Uruguay I think? Anyways there are a lot of details I’m skipping but it was fun to watch.,
Buy a gourd smash it in your yard. Infinite gourds forever. Serious its a problem I left one out 4-5 years ago for animals to eat and now every year like 15 to 20 grow.,
# [AW SHIT SHIT SHIT](https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/sites/cet.com/files/MIAMI-2-.JPEG),
This price is insulting, grow your own or have none at all. 2.48 a pound for a gourd is nuts,
There are 2 types of WSBers - Before Gourd, and After Gourd (BG, AG),
No this is peak gourd buying season. Wait till the holidays are over, that's when the real dip happens,
They were called pumpkins last month. 📉,
Any GOURDS you buy today will depreciate in value. Seems like a good time to look for some call options.,
Puts on gourds,
Oh my gourd.,
Finally, some enriching content on wsb. Ahhh \*sips Luckin Coffee\*,
oh my gourd,
All in on $WINCO,
About that WINCO life!,
Good Gourd, our prices our crazy!,
I fucking love WinCo,
Winco is an employee-owned store that doesn't take credit cards,
That’s what I call my Willy now that my wife left me,
 Not looking at the pic, I'd have said, "Insider",
Only the penis shaped gourds…,
Bro we are talking about ornamental gourds not $WISH, there is no bad price to buy in at,
I don’t see any rocket emojis, wait for 2.60. Buy high sell low.,
Wait for the dip,
The Myth, The Legend,
Wait for the dip,
I would put my buy limit at 2.25 it had a pretty big gap to fill,
I bought a gourd that lasted till two thousand seventeen, washed my hands of it saw it as a big rotting machine,
Due to Turkey day, I'd say there might be a dip before the rocket 🚀🚀🚀,
Wait for the pullback,
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
buy wholesale, never retail!,
This time of year they are gonna be close to expiration so the time decay will be a bitch,
Wait for the next black friday, the dip is gonna be deeper,
i'm a buyer at 2,
It's decorative gourd season motherfuckers,
If they ran out of gourds, go to the bakery aisle they always have a spare tart,
Yes,
Not yet, the dip will keep on dipping. But make sure to dip your dip in the dip,
IT’S HAPPENING!!!,
Look up Papua New Guinea and gourds, lol,
Ah, a man of discrete tastes.  I like you.,
Says it’s low price… so yes.. buy the dip,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Yes, put some demand on it. I got 2.50 Call expiring next Fri.,
Dunno about you, but I’m all in on futures. This is just a dip, the future is BRIGHT.,
This is original and hilarious 

You deserve a pat in the back 👍,
yes yes yes.,
You shouldn’t end your sentences with a preposition,
Buy as much as you can, there's tons of growth in that market,
this will never get old,
Don't forget to buy bags,
How was the summer in Argentina this year?,
Just yesterday out of nowhere I remembered and reread the epic gourds thread from earlier this year. And now this. Classic,
Hey look they cost almost as much as a WISH share,
See this? Made it farming.

https://youtu.be/_pDTiFkXgEE,
OMG thank you for the memories,
Ok wow so gourd,
Price inflates to $2.50 next year: LAMBO HERE I COME!!,
As long as you bought high , you are allowed to sell low if you sell before New Years.   Nobody uses New Years gourds anymore.,
No bro you need to buy some shorts and futures on gourds. Balance gains with losses. Just kidding. Borrow against it and make bank bro,
Just scale it up toll you have something that you can comprehend in your brain. And see if then the price is still on par with other brands.,
The story coming in from the WSJ is that investors are now flocking to gourd futures as safe haven assets,
I've just seen one of the last comments of The Gourdfather himself is that he now wants to get peyotes for his chronic pain.

The guy is one of a kind.,
I would say yes- but with my history, it’ll be $1 tomorrow,
Stay away from those penny stonks,
I just watch a YouTube video 
Dude used this for a example,
I'd love to buy some Asian guards at that price.,
The power of WinCo is strong with this post.,
It still makes me smile that the man responsible for this meme probably lives like five miles from me.,
I feel like they’ll peak right around January…,
Pro tip. Pick up BDRY on the pullback. Looking extremely bullish,
Fuck yeah per pound man. Killer deal.,
Hold til February 👍,
I know a Winco Foods when I see one 🧐,
The best thing about this meme is I never really noticed gourds until after the meme😂,
Vietnam flashback,
Yeah but I gotta see these gourds,
I prefer to buy HoHos...from Craigslist.,
I understood that reference,
I'll give ya 10 sheckels,
Excellent price. Literally can’t go tits up,
Lol I remember this,
Bruh DCA,  buy 2 a day till Xmas, then hodl.,
What’s the option chain looking like?,
Yes.,
get out of my winco,
Didn’t you sell before November?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
WINCO baby,
Definitely! Buying the day after defeats the purpose of the hodl!,
This is funny. Burrrr,
Oh my GOURD,
Wowza that is a call back.,

https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers,
hahaha, \*burps\* oh my gourd,
Gaara approves,
LOLOLOL good pull,
Wait until it dips,
Nah, that’s ATH. That’s why everyone is buying now. Give it a few weeks and I expect a big correction come January.,
Oh my Gourd!! I remember the last time someone invested in those.,
The best dips are in the refrigerated section!,
WINCO always got them low prices,
I was there.  Gourds be damned,
Buy ALL the gourds at low price, then when everyone needs gourds?   $$$,
oh my gourd.,
You'll be better off buying $TMC,
Bro that's a winco which means we're neighbors let's hang!!,
Any technicals?,
Fuck yeah, WinCo,
Bro that sign is racist.,
OH MY GOURD! Great price.,
It’s decorative gourd season motherfuckers,
Oh my gourd!,
That's WinCo foods!,
WinCo fam,
Nah wait 2 years until we have a new President,
Too soon.,
That's the ask. Try a $2.43 bid and see if it'll fill.,
Shit, I did a limit order for 3.96 that filled. I’m fuqed,
$2.48 for this gourd? Are you ‘avin a laugh?,
Yo this is definitely a winco.,
whatever ever the price just buy and hold,
Since when are ornaments sold by the Lb?,
You’re paying way too much. Who’s your guard guy?,
You reap what you sow,
Gourds are back! The Emperor was, as always, right.

Because of the Omicron Variant, massive restrictions will be put in place and the ONLY thing that keeps you sane during all that is.....that is right folks, you guessed it: GOURDS!

Grab some while you can! You just know they will be even shorter than toilet papers! Special deal too! Cheaper by the lb! Dont buy by Kg! That is double the price!,
Fucking lel. Top kek op.,
Ornamental Gourds. That's like buying a Dividend ETF instead of just buying SPY. Just buy regular gourds dude. They don't last as long, they're more unpredictable, they're generally riskier. Everything checks out.,
ALL HAIL WINCO.,
no, i think you should short it,
Farmer mate said that seed price is shit, answering for a friend,
https://youtu.be/e3QRTToTLzI,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Is it weird that I know which winco this is,
Bro, I love Winco.,
2.48 are you out of your gourd?,
$2.48 for the gourd.  $2.48!!!!  Look at it, that's worth ten if it's worth a shekel.

You just gave it to me for nothing.

Yes, but it's *worth* ten.

All right, all right.

No, no, no.  It's not worth ten.  You're supposed to argue.,
Wait for the report from Clarence Beeks,
Buy the futures instead,
Oh My Gourd,
Short it,
If you don’t buy now your gourd might as well be ornamental,
These gourds will definitely expire worthless,
Ah, WinCo. I see you are an ape of class.,
Don't be fooled. It's a depreciating asset. 👀,
**goes up to cashier**

I refuse to pay any less than $4.48/lb!,
Physical Delivery, Baby.,
Is this a Winco? God I love and miss that place,
Hey that's winco. Means you live in the rockies or close by.,
Know a Winco when I see it,
Man I miss living near a WinCo,
WinCo prices are typically pretty good. I feel like you're ahead of the market here.,

Idk... I’m long on LCID but I think this is a good play. I reduced my position, looking for this to dip into the 40’s to buy back.  For sure overvalued right now.  Good chance these calls don’t get exercised.  Either way you probly don’t care cause you made some $$$$.,
$60 is too low IMO, it’s going to have an all time high breakout and run to $100+,
Fuck I was bout to say good job then I scrolled down a bit more and this is my reply I'm there wit you,
Good job!,
Ive been doing the same since september, cash cow baby,
Ya dun goofed,
Gosh Selling calls is so retarded,

Ethical social experiment: we find a real bad crackhead and teach him everything there is to know about investing. We put him in a cage and we buy him as much crack as he earns in the market each day. Bet you he would beat Warren Buffett within a week.,
Ugh I gotta get off the couch and walk up stairs to work in 10 mins, why is life so hard,

Buying MRNA calls on Friday was the most obvious non retarded play and I didn’t do it,
You’d think that with a new variant, OCGN may finally see the light of gains. It’s a trap. Don’t do it. You have so much left to live for,
oh my god I had twtr calls expiring this week that were like -95% on friday and I just decided to let them ride,
The guy who bought 80 grand in spy puts Friday deleted his account lmao,
This isn’t even JPows final form yet,
Sometimes you just want to get up at 615 and make spaghetti in nothing but your boxers,
Sold my MRNA stock pre-market.  Think hype is at a maximum rn, capturing the pop.

In a few days when everyone settles the fuk down about Omnicron and people realize it isn't a big deal, gonna jump back in.  Super bullish on MRNA long-term - vaccines for cancer, HIV, future pandemics.,

It’s kind of hilarious Omicron was the excuse for the sell off when initial studies indicate it’s a mild variant and might be beneficial as a vaccine alternative in Africa. Puts on restraint.,

Bears it’s been almost 2 years, you really should stop fighting the trend,
Bears. When you see 2% down day on SPY, there are three outcomes:

1: V recovery- You get fuk

2: dead cat bounce -you get fuk unless you hold long dated options (you don't)

3: black swan crash- keep betting on this and you wont have any money left for when the actual black swan happens.,

If SPY closes above 466 and QQQ closes above 400 that’s giga bullish.,
Don't let yourself be the schmuck that works a 9-5 for 40 years in hopes of retiring while ivory tower bastards who never held a real job inflate away your savings while jerking off to the sounds of 300 million poor bastards crying in anguish at their broken dreams. Fight back, yolo options, and blow the fucking system up in a cataclysm of retardation and nonsensical prices. And whatever you do, make sure not to do an honest day of real work for these pig-fucking corporate sociopaths that deindustrialized and sold out the nation for the last 50 years.,

SPY is on crack right now,
“We would be aggressive buyers of this pullback,” wrote Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday night. “As with the case for Beta and Delta variants, the ‘bark’ has proven worse than the bite in each of those precedent instances. The market carnage, in our view, will be short-lived and transitory.”

I love it when everything bad is transitory. USA USA USA,
My friends, if that "dip" from 466.50 to 465.90 ruined your gains... You might be over leveraged.,

Always remember to jerk off before making a financial decision. The post-nut clarity will cleanse those biases. I was gonna buy Bumble earlier this month. I was convincing myself that it's because it's a good company, but really I was just simping for their CEO. It's down 33%, so dodged a bullet with that one.,

Even when auto loans go to shit they don't lose that much money.  
They repossess the cars and have multiple ways to off load them and reclaim value from the loan.  
  
> as the economy stabilizes  
  
There are not enough drugs in this country ...,
Good thoughts here, however I think people will do almost anything to hold onto their cars. This includes the mistake of refinancing an auto loan. And that just increases cash flow to the industry.,
A friend of mine owns a few buy/ pay here lots. He was explaining lenders want these loans to default. They get to repo the car using GPS technology, takes 1 day or less usually no conflict like on TV, they get to recycle the car, new loan, new fees , new cash down payment , rinse repeat.,
They just repo the cars. How many cars in your strategy get totaled? Cause that straight up happens a lot. I didn’t even know sub-prime loans were a thing for cars. Toyota just put out a statement that they have zero chip shortage problems. So they are back to No. 1 soon and I’m assuming that 1 or 2 other manufacturers are going to have their demands met a tiny bit sooner than estimated if Toyota is all good already.,
This. A thousand times this. 

Not to mention the credit card receivables that have been securitized. Once interest rates begin to rise, there will be considerable pressure on securities that contain these assets that will only increase downside risk.,
I think ALLY has large exposure to this lending as well,
Just punch yourself in the nuts to save yourself some time…..,

It was a dip before you bought, now it s gonna be a top,
It's still wildly overvalued.,
Can I ask why you didn't buy ATH and sell the dip?,
Get out witch. We dont want your Voodoo.,

I think these might actually print but I don't think it's happening in 2021. We are probably getting a pullback in January before another leg higher prints,

Looking good now, gangster move,
UPDATE: Considered selling today for +50%, but think there is more juice to squeeze.,

I don't think I've ever seen a Vanguard screen shot on here before,
She literally slayed Intel by herself, they were on the verge of bankruptcy when she took over. I wish I wasn’t broke at that time because I liked them as a long-term hold. However, even I didn’t see them going from 2 to 150.,

It's because I'm levered up to my tits. 

SPY goes down 2% and I get fcked.,
He might have seen an ape inside the mercedes,
All the rainbow bears coming out of their holes when markets fall 2% from ATHs.,
More like when black Friday bears see the sunday night futures,
This happened the last time I bought spy calls in February of 20.  I should quit buying spy calls,
All you have to do to scare a bear is scream? Bears are some bi\*ches,
This mother fucker opened a car door. It knew to open it..,
Typical bear. Get excited about measly gains, only to loose it all.

Edit: Typo,
*BEARS ON CYBER MONDAY*,
Bears gonna get fucked hard tomorrow,
Ha that guy sounds like SpongeBob screaming,
You can hear the moment they realised all you have to do is keep screaming and the bear goes away.,
Wondering what the bear saw in the car,
thx for reminding me to lock my car door,
Is JPOW in the car?,
That Mercedes has a very unique car alarm.,
Don’t forget the debt ceiling will be up on Friday this week,
Sound on for full effect lol,
Even the bear knew Mercedes are a money pit.,
Okay, am I missing something by viewing this on my phone?  Couldn't make out if the gay bear was sporting a raging hard on, or was flaccid, and running over the edge cliff?,
Yep won’t see the bears around for long it’s hibernation time!,
Why are Americans always so screamy?,
🐻🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈,
fucking moron screaming like that.,
That is why Apes together are better than gay Bears or Bulls. Ape strong together.,
I've seen this posted here a hundred times over the years, but today's the first day I watched it with sound on.  Fantastic!,
u/savevideobot,
60 to 1 leverage will do that to ya,
The bear was like BRUH CHILL WTF, I WAS JUST CHECKING THE KEYS INSIDE.....,
"Why are you stealing my mercedes Bear? Go away bear, i'll pepper spray you",
Bears be like ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
Bear please. Thats my kayak. Round 2.,
I love this video so damn much!,
Holup?!,
Lol, I was laughing out so loud at my work place ha ha aha ha,
These David Attenborough outtakes are hilarious.,
When I logged that day in my depot and saw a four figure crash, I was not thinking "OMGourd!"

I bought calls on SPY. Not much, mind you....my play money is not as impressive as of so many people here.

But I thought....that is what the spirit is supposed to be.,
That's the hood for ya.,
Lmao I lost evrything I went -99 on Friday,
Nice car alarm, I see you got the texas chainsaw massacre update,

Hey /u/New-Coconut-7323, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
How will I lose money unless I see moons or memes?,
Not enough rocketships or diamonds, a bit sketched by this dd tbh,
I was in early on, as I have one and it’s great. It’s basically an Apple product, sleek af

However I sold my shares so that I could buy Novavax calls

To answer ur question , fuck MRNA, NVAX to the moon!!,
The part that's overlooked is how their reader and the current situation gives them a boost into long term telehealth. Beyond the huge integrations they have with the DoD, Google, Netflix, etc. they rolled out a consumer platform that enables subscription based access to doctors. Coupled with the ability to have trusted diagnostics at home this points them well ahead of most other tele-health that can only handle surface level issues or refer you to on-site testing. They also just announced that the Covid testing is CDC compliant and is usable for entry into the states. Whatever you think about testing needs, some form of this is staying around for a while.

The Covid testing is allowing them to get a few 100k folks into this subscription service, with their employers covering it, and with diagnostics as an ad on fee they are positioned well to be able to bill various medical codes directly to insurance. This is way more than a covid testing company. Their roadmap includes a bunch of stuff people will test for if they've already got a reader in their house and an app that can get results reviewed by a doctor.,

Why waste the money on buybacks when they should invest in their business that just went bankrupt. Are they insane?,
From bankruptcy to ordering $10b worth of vehicles and $2b shares buyback.  
BTW they have only $3.5b cash & $9b in debts based on Q3 filings,
ooohhh HTZ looking real juicy!!!!!!,
Lmao i cant anymore![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
How they don't have any money?,
Let me translate: "So long and thanks for all the ca$h!",
The fuck? They’re buying 100k Teslas and a $2 billion buyback. Whoever joked about Hertzcoin was dead on.,
What a complete joke.

It's about damned time this scam made the news, i STILL haven't received the gorilla i adopted yet.,
Buy more calls on Rwandan mountain gorillas.,
Sadly, I received an email that the baby gorilla I adopted may have died.  His family group crossed into the Congo, but when they returned, he wasn't among them.,
I got my shirt, did you all?

My sweet little Suraurwanda!,
Put on my shirt from them today. Had no idea they were gonna be on tv!,
It's amazing what happens when your cocaine allowance gets spent on something more important,
This was one of the best things this sub ever did,

They were already closed for tourists,
Yup. Green dildos,
Market will react...with a hulk green dildo,
Lol my calls are already up by 30%,
I have a trip to Japan planned with my girlfriends family (gf flex) for March of 2022... Should I just cancel this shit instead then rebook it in like 2025 or 2030 whenever this gay covid shit is over with? seems to make more sense rather postponing it every 3-4 months?,
In Italy media have already said the omicron variant effect are not so worrying and vaccine should work,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Ain’t omicron the leader of the autobots?,
It’s priced in, my guy,
Future are looking good for now, however Japan market lost 1.63% or 467.70¥. 

It means gravity will eat those future positive gains immediately the market open leaving few with losses today.,
The US is going to pull a commodore perry 2.0 on japan soon,
Omg!!!! Not omicron!!!! This is crazy,
This is so silly. Omnicron is the cure. It’s more contagious but waaaaay less deadly. It’ll overtake delta, give everyone immunity and then fizzle out.,
Yup, it’s goin up lmao,
didn't Burry invest in a lot of Japanese stock?,
Lol good luck with those puts,
"... by New Foreigners"

"... foreign tourists are already banned from visiting."

When you need to post cause you cant nut to NNN.,
Well Japan has a issue with Africans anyway I'm not surprised by this action.,
Yes this has been in effect for a while,
Just in time for the Mid-Term elections! Force mail in voting. It’s been political since day one,
No, market won’t react,
Someone will benefit. Hedge properly. If they close buy stocks like FB, ZM, Activision, Pharma etc. if they don’t buy hotels, airlines etc.,
"There's a highly contagious disease heading our way!"

"Seal the borders and stop all travel... in a day or two.",
You've got to be a complete clown at this point if you're falling for the FUD,

Buying GME on margin. That's just precious.,
Now this is what I call a  good use of Robinhood gold $5/mo membership.,
Waits till GME is at $232, 10 months after the first pump to yolo his life savings... On robinhood... With Margin... on GME.

Theres retarted... then theres this guy.,
You don’t happen to walk around with a helmet on… all the time do you?,
We should really pin the gambling addiction hotline number just in case,
Should’ve dropped your net worth on OTM calls,
Wow. Good luck.,
You are home.,
At least there's no theta to worry about, ~~beta~~ the margin call is going to need attention.

&#x200B;

"You know how to become a Millionaire? 

  Start as a Billionaire.",
Must be cold in the winter with those fucking brass balls - Wow good luck to you sir.,
I am terrified for his wife.,
I'm pretty sure this is how people end up hanging from a ceiling fan,
A true yolo.  Best of luck with this one.,
What’s liquidation price?,
Bro this is not the move. When GME moons, margin positions especially on Robinhood are gonna be closed and liquidated. Do not be surprised if Robinhood decides to change margin requirements or sells your position for you.,
How did you buy Gme on margin? I thought it has a 100% requirement,
Holy shit, this is fucking….. not genius…. What’s the word. Oh right, retarded,
Nice. I'm in your boat. Might get some more tomorrow at open.,
Eh the negative number could be bigger,
You'll be a legend come january/february. Check out gherkinit's DD. Sure this could drag out till 2023 but SHF are way more fucked this time around. I just dont want to give them any more time to de leverage. Either way, great company,
Congrats you will be a billionaire soon(not a financial advice),
Rest In Peace OP for using margin,
Bruh u can't buy when it was at 167?
What are you a stupid clown?😹,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
Can you tell me when you do a play like this the next time so I can do the opposite?,
!remindme 1 mo,
Sell 28x covered calls at the $250 strike weekly for big income.,
Don’t worry GME is getting into metaverse and NFTs it will moon again,
Wow I always realise how fortunate I am in life.,
Never go full retard, also... Never go full retard x2,
GME will soar to 400 by years end, you'll know it is true.,
I mean.. On the bright side, you will be able to claim a tax loss for many years after you inevitably get margin called. So there's that,
Welcome home,
Buy high sell low,
I'm gonna be honest with you, this is not gonna get better.,
This’ll be fun.,
Holy guacamole!

I would say good luck… but it’s GME.

No luck needed 😉

*I’m a space bound rocket ship and your portfolios the moooooooon*,
He's down 112k so far,
undervalued stock tbh,
$232 avg…..I definitely wanna see that loss porn in a couple weeks,
You are so fucked you damn, dirty ape!,
Now this is the kind of shit I'm here to see. Godspeed you glorious retard.,
Want to know why this is stupid?

You bought on margin a highly volatile stock that allows for your shares to be borrowed against and sold short. You also look to be purchasing on robinhood whom turned off the buy button in Jan and not a reputable broker. If the price tanks and your shares are sold from under you then it is due to multiple things but the main thing is not reading any DD and pulling idiotic moves like the one pictured. You DO NOT have my sympathy but you do have my luck. Being on margin means you are going to be a lot more panicky if this shit drops to $160-$180 again.

I'm betting this is what we see in a few days because anyone that is actually in GME and has paid the slightest bit of attention has moved off robinhood long ago.,
Soon you'll be at -100% net worth, nice!,
You know there are two types of people in this world, those who deserve to be poor and those who don't deserve to be rich. Somehow you are both!,
😬,
100% retarded,
F,
I’m balls deep in BB, AMC, and Internet money.,
don’t love the cost basis here,
RIP,
Not too bad,
GUH! $ROPE,
December 11th will be a bad day for you.,
What % when broker trigger margin call? And liquid all the shares at market price?,
Tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀,
Smort,
I wish i had money like this to just play with with zero worries.,
False. Robinhood doesn’t allow 100% margin on gme

Good luck though,
Let’s go!!,
Hey so a lot of hate… GameStonk made WSB… wild you all hate her so much, congratulations OP you’ll like 1000x your net worth @ 10k a share which isn’t even TSLA mkt cap! So les go

Ps : this is not financial advice or analysis just my YoLo mind appreciating what your doing,
GME kids are fucking dumb,
Get the fuck off margin and read some DD Jesus Christ,
This is sad to look at. Of all the stocks that are skyrocketing up, you choose GME....,
People this stupid do t deserve that amount of money. Even if half isn’t theirs,
Chad,
Honestly nobody cares that you are going to loose literally all your money. Take you nonsense elsewhere,
God I love you fucking retard,
The bigger the dollar amount between 200% and 0% is the difference in if it matters. "If you owe the bank "100 yada yada blah blah" and what not,
Holy fuck you figured it out,
Godspeed. But someone that knows op in real keep an eye on him if gamestop goes asleep,
I’m hard from seeing this,
Why didn’t you buy when price was lower?,
This is why Shkreli tried to ban YOLOs...,
As stupid as this is, you will probably have more money than most of us Monday evening. Good luck!,
God bless you on your moon mission fellow retard,
Please be careful,
Can you sell CCs against shares on margin, because this might be slightly less retarded than it seems,
Margin is restricted to 50% by law…,
Awaiting the epic loss porn,
dat average cost is fuckup,
They belong in here,
And you’re fucked/rich,
Futures looking great,
Lfg🚀🚀🚀,
Yes dude YES,
Have fun retard,
Margin for GME= actual retard,
You are dumb,
Well, now that’s just excessive,
Imagine having your net worth in Robinhood.,
Post the loss porn later,
Well at least there is a new variant.
But maybe the market will get hit so hard even meme stocks will dive,
He's got the biggest, balls of them all.

Fucking sell Mortimer,
y tho,
Gg,
I've heard of *fashionably late*... but this?,
Ape,
OP maybe 300% retarded,
He sellin CCs if hes smart,
Bruh, end of day friday weeklies would've netted you 8600 bucks in CC and that's at over your strike price in the unlikely scenario you're assigned. You could make that back in 2 weeks with 10-15 OTM CC...,
Dumbass, I love it,
It’s sad, even as a lurker, to see how far WSB has plummeted with all these shit posts. 

Month old account with highly cropped image showing GME shares bought on margin, boy if that ain’t karma farming.,
!Remindme 1 month,
At the end of your play, you’ll either be a god among apes or a retard,
Ill meet you behind the wendys next week, you better have brushed  your teeth this time.,
I sure hope you're selling covered calls...,
Smart ape,
I see you got in on the Dip. Good buy and I’ll have a beer with you on the moon.,
Say goodbye to twice your net worth holy fuck. Praise be to you.,
GME always tanks post earnings.,
Now this is the type of autist shit I can get behind. Just show me where to sign.,
That’s retarded. Congratulations, you’re one of us now!,
Somehow I don't think so.,
BIG DIG GAINS,
You are gonna get wreck,
Why,
Gme go brrrrrrrrrr,
You are rarted,
You poor dumb fucker.:,
I can only imagine selling CC with this amount of shares,
Please live stream your margin call.,
GME GANG RISE UP,
Time to take le L,
You should get some AMC too, for diversification,
Bro give me one…,
Have your tried buying puts to hedge your losses? Maybe sell some covered calls to get back some capital.,
Start selling covered calls against your shares and pay off that margin.  You can make 10k a week easy, if you know how to handle it,
WSB comment sections are fucking hilarious. But this thread is just pure gold.,
[removed],
Portfolio diversity 100.00%. The right kind of diversification!,
I was up 250 k and got margin called down to 0. Good stuff,
dude sell covered calls to lower your cost basis WTF

28 calls at the $230 strike for the 23rd is 1443 x 28 at median or 1260x28 at the bid price. 35k for holding shares. if you get assigned you have made profit. 

If you don't get assigned you do it again and make more profit which lowers your cost basis,
Good timing moon soon,
Someone from RH risk management is going to come into the office this morning, sit down and look at the top alerts in their inbox and at the very top will be a message about you. Said employee is going to sit there for 10 minutes staring a their screen while their mind tries to process what they are seeing as this is clearly the dumbest thing they have ever seen.,
the fuck were you thinking man,
masterpiece,
You forgot the 300% Genius part,
You seem to struggle with simple tasks,
Bro you gotta move on,
Important question: Are you gonna DRS your shares?,
This is probably the most retarded thing I've seen this year.,
You went full retard. I hope it works out for you,
Ooooh boy you are retarded!!,
Selling calls I hope.,
Your one scary mofo,
[removed],
This is either fake or extremely retarded,
I don’t like it.


I LOVE IT!!!,
8008135,
For gods sake sell calls on them at least to pay off your interest and some margin. The stock is not squeezing,
I actually think you’ll do alright on this play. You definitely could have done this a few months ago when it was in the 160 range but I don’t think it will drop to your margin call either. What the rate your paying for this everyday ?

Good luck man !,
why?,

Pretty much sums up Wallstreet's animosity toward the retail trader with a little bit of firepower in their hands.,
The new COD looks lit!,
Well…. We know how this is gonna end don’t we. Here come the apes,
“Dumb” versus “Smart” money,
Lmao is this real 😂,
Caesar!!,
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen!!!!  I love the stock market, I love the planet of the apes, I love shooting movies. This is the trifecta.,
WSB must've bought Hollywood this weekend, place smells and looks like ape shit and look at the product.

This is the way,
“I’ll teach you hairless mother fuckers a thing or two about Gorilla warfare”,
This video never gets old,
Beware the beast Man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours.,
Retail should’ve took out r/RealTesla. Holy shit that is a depressing sorry lot of people.,
You can insert this scene into the 3rd Planet of the Apes and no one would question it.,
God's Clowns, at it again,
0DTE options is prolly like giving a monkey an RPG,
Papa,
Speaking of options, what's y'all's thoughts on buying undervalued $LCID LEAPS?,
Apes win!,
This is how planet of the apes starts,
Rise of the Apes.,
Living legend..,
Never get old 😂😂,
Welcome to Africa! Land of the tribes... a bit like WSB.,
Planet of the Apes: Origins,
Though that they are the only monkeys who can use rifle,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Yeeeaahhh! Good for him  👏👏👏👍🐒💝,
Does anyone else see the resemblance? Asking for a friend.,
Technically that’s me,
 I feel like it’s an issue that I don’t know what an option is,
That diamond hands at the end had me ☠️😂😂,
I must have missed this part of Far Cry 3,
Imagine getting shot and dying by a monke,
TSLA vehicles are completely unreliable, but the stock isn’t!,

Dorsey steps down, TWTR up 11%. 
Gets replaced by other TWTR exec, stock loses all gains and another 2.75%. 

Seriously, they could have chosen a college freshman and received a better response. 
Short shares and use the money to buy puts.,
This is a weird fucking thread to read the comments in. Forgot I was in WSB for a second.,
Indian guy as a Tech company CEO, based on what history has told us this is a bullish signal. Thank me later.. Still don't understand why all tech companies haven't replaced their CEO with an Indian dude yet TBH,
1 censorship scumbag replaces another.,
This guy thinks all white people are racist😭😭 wtf with this company,
Jack gone was actually bullish but this guy is just as bad ... oh well ima just stick to amd,
New guy is an anti-free speech communist. Stock is on freefall.  https://i.imgur.com/l5r4Cba.jpg https://i.imgur.com/rEwanV3.jpg https://i.imgur.com/ppd8ToJ.jpg,

Dorsey can go fuck himself,
Imagine being forced to have a beer with this guy and he’s telling you about the first time he got his dick sucked by a dude at burning man while he was high on 2C-B,
Dorsey needs to be held accountable for violating the free speech of American citizens while providing a platform for jihadi terrorists,
All you right wing political numbnuts who are still butthurt because he banned the orange man, can stay the fuck away from this thread. This is not a political discussion board, take your sorry asses to r/anal,
Adios you smug fuck. What’s the over/under they find a bunch of dead twinks in his basement?,
Resigned cause he's should be in jail!,
Tomorrow: Twitter only hiring H1Bs from india

to the dumb, i'm calling him racist,
Homeless guy bout to take his rightful place.,

Hey /u/Sam_the_Engineer, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Jokes on me for selling at $27,
I bought at $15 and sold at $22 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
DD but without a single dollar figure in the post

Also, "as foreclosures start to happen" 😂,
I've used the product with subscription.  It's expensive and a game changer in the industry.  Totally saves companies money in so so many ways.  With that said today I sold mine at 30.69.  Bought at 18.85.  Probably will hop in again another day!!!,
I dumped my position this morning I had an AC of 22 per share but I want to try and get in a little lower so I’m gonna start selling puts on them.  Or 2 puts is all I can afford with collateral rn lol,
Weird that MTTR is doing so well with their latest earnings call having abysmal net income and profit margin, but hurray for this mythical metaverse I guess,
Just bought puts on MTTR. Let’s see,
Matterport calls have been absolutely printing. I've found a great pattern with this stock. 

Selling CCs on it too. If anyone thinks it can hit $40 by December 17th. Feel free to buy my calls. 

I think this is institutional volume. Volume was at 3 mil this morning and suddenly jumped to 6 mil within minutes. Institutional investors hopping on the bandwagon. 

With Matterport Digitizing U.S. Government Infrastructure, any news about the infrastructure bill will affect the stock.

Growth potential continues to be huge.,
In at 21, still riding,
Any time I see this shill DD's I buy puts.,
What’s a matter port?,

Forgot to mention… Since I sold this morning, I have enough to pay for the downpayment on a house now!  Huge financial milestone today.  Will be popping champagne.,
(Deleted),
Why? Just Why?

Too bad the market already bled me dry on Friday.,
Aaaannnnd…

10Year is below 1.5%…
==================================

JPOW is restarting the printer…
==================================

BRRRRRRRRRR💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
==================================,
Powell will be speaking. that always sends the markets down.,
New variants are old news. They won't be what causes a real correction.,
Bears about to catch a crippling case of Ligma,
Anybody have more crayons? I ate all mine,
You donkeys keep looking at covid but in reality it's Asian market that has fucked us Friday. Evergrande will hurt.,
Direct quote from my mother in law at Thanksgiving: "I get the flu shot every year, because I'm high risk...but I believe our bodies should just build their own immunity to COVID" 🤔😅,
Spring this bear trap!,
Still bears around? Holy.,
Futes are up but this is likely a bull trap. Pls wait until 10:30 before trading everyone,
Futures look good to start Monday..... yep, wait until Tuesday....  Or jump in hard at open knowing all 2.5% will be recovered, just to watch it bleed away, then sell on stop loss before the Tuesday recovery...  that's my plan anyway....,
How long do you retards think it’ll take before there is a case in the US and everyone freaks out and the market takes a giant shit?,
Black Friday, bloody Monday.,
It says everybody gets boosted or we get fucked. Good luck getting that coordinated,
WHO doing it’s damndest this morning with negative press releases to make US and Euro stocks turn negative.,
New vaccine discovered MoRoN-A,
[deleted],
Jobs report coming up on Friday is supposed to be strong, and futures showing markets will open up. I think this variant hasn’t shown to be that horrific just yet. My vote is the week is a toss up, but I’m leaning it will end up.,
I would give it till Tuesday,
plz stop,
Wouldn't this be good for bears since Feds would tighten quicker and raise interest rate sooner?,
i bought after hours on friday, LETS GOOO!,
Fck I should’ve bought on the dip fml,
Ha. Right. New variant couldn't possibly increase selling pressure in a globalized economy.,
Can’t wait one of my positions is up 25% today already in Australia,
A title of a true WSB retard.

No vaccine is ready, MRNA are TESTING booster candidates against the Omicron variant.

It does not mean they changed the vaccine for the Omicron variant, it means they already planned on those boosters regardless.

It will take them up to two weeks to even know if the vaccines protect against Omicron. It will take Pfizer/BioNTech 100 days to create and test a modified vaccine if it doesn't protect against the Omicron.

South Africa also has less than 24% vaccination rate so any data from them regarding vaccination efficacy against the Omicron is probably irrelevant.,
[removed],
There will always be a new variant. Resist!,
They’re concerned that they could help it evade the body’s immune response and make the variant - named B.1.1.529 - more transmissible.
12 july 21 
What did they discover? 
Humans are in the world more stupidi than chickens
Be careful to buy, lockdown are back on political table, because vaccine is still not injected with the new modification for variant strain  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/how-scientists-detect-new-covid-19-variants/,
Pre-market looking 🔥,
Big bull trapped,
Hahahaha the virus is no match for our technology,

“Worst variant ever” is like apple’s polyitically correct marketing strategy of “Best I phone ever”.,
Nothing surprising, they have always been conservative and are now following China’s footstep towards a closed border policy, so be it, see how much the world gives a fuck about this,
FUD FUD FUD!!!!,
It's just another variant, nothing has changed except the hype by the media,
Does anyone believe this bullshit?,
I doubt it will be the "worst possible", this is basically just bluster so the 🌈🐻 crowd can salvage some scraps from one of their worst years.

Japan burned through a Delta surge just weeks ago leaving a lot of natural immunity, plus the nation is highly vaxxed. I'm guessing they probably just want to keep the Africans out,
Omicron is fake. They skipped Xi. This is Xi variant and China is asshoe. Short all China stocks,
FUD looks like the Chinese just want things cheaper, offload the variant. Almost like the windows update.,
Japan prepares for the sniffles,
JPOW about to go Godzilla on this market, this is noise,
japan commiting economic sepuku over a sniffles variant right after they leave the hole left by their assets bubble 30 years ago... Can't make this shit up.,
Godzilla won't allow anything too bad to happen.,

nio park already under construction,
I love Nio, and don't really mind the fact that they're Chinese based (which the rest of WSB hates (understandably)). But I'm not a fan of the fact they have to outsource all of their manufacturing and don't seem to be mentioning their progress towards setting up a dedicated factory. 

Idk .. for the amount of capital they've raised over the past few years, they don't seem to actually be doing much.

But then on the flip side of that, they are expanding out their battery replacement stations all the time. So maybe that's where they're focusing capital?

Overall I'm bullish on NIO,
They are planning to open factory in Poland: [https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/r3hpyt/nios\_job\_ad\_reveals\_plan\_to\_build\_factory\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/r3hpyt/nios_job_ad_reveals_plan_to_build_factory_in/),
It will be interesting to see how the quality holds. On the surface it looks great and the price point offers more people opportunity.,
Whats the new battery range of ET7 OP??,
if it wasnt a chinese stock id be all over it.,
maserati is a trash brand so its a bad comparison. i had a friend who bought one and returned it in a month because the car only looks good on the outside. interior is trash. the maserati logo fell off the stick shift, everything looked like cheap plastic

&#x200B;

but yes, nio has a promising future. hopefully the new EV credit in the USA will open up doors to foreign EV manufacturers,
First class, keep on spreading such news,
reminds of a tesla,
NIO is just a really good Chinese android following tsla iphone world,
Looks like they took a tesla mode 3 and distorted the headlights,
Nio going to moon a lot of upcoming news in December Nio day on the 18th.,
I'm a simple man, I see a company name here, I buy it without reading the post, to the moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀,
You're crazy if you don't see Nio's future Chinese or not.,
do you see any american driving Nio? yea.. they can f off,
Bring pltr back not nio pumping,
Are you the $60 bag holder?,

Ladies and gentlemen, the CCP,
This seems like a good buying opportunity to me. The one place in the world where folks are more degenerate gamblers than here on WSB is Macau, the entire government operates off gambling and Asian elites flock there to waste millions. Even if some junket operators got axed, the casinos and the wealthy who gamble there will still remain.,
Remember when reddit asked whether r/wallstreetbets gambles? Lol,

Literally can't go tits up. Can't wait to see your loss porn next month.,
OP I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE COMPANIES THAT HAD MEH OR SHIT EARNINGS THIS YEAR AND RETHINK THIS STRAT.,
"Thats a bold strategy, Cotton. Lets see if it pays off for him....",
I think you should delete this before everyone makes you cry,
The market is designed so that once the majority of participants start to think that this is the way, it is suddenly no longer the way.   You have to assume that your thoughts about the market are what "they" want you to think, and that those thoughts are the same as the majority of other participants, and then you look for the counteraction.,
Why not you're only wrong 50 percent of the time.,
IV isn’t just something you put in your arm to mainline vodka.,
I tried to short lucid because they had a bad earnings but sure enough my puts expired worthless and their stock stayed high on bad earnings.,
Throw puts on BIG. Throw calls on NTAP and CRM.  Potential puts on JKS. I'm playing puts on JKS, but it's not 100% because of the Friday drop. Thank me later.,
[deleted],
I’ve been thinking about earnings reactions this year, too, and thinking maybe I will play each one with a straddle, or maybe a strangle leaning toward the side I feel best about. Max loss would be the sum of my premiums, and that would only happen if the price stayed flat after earnings.,
I wait if there’s an overreaction after earnings and open a position then. Shorted CAR after it pumped 100% post earnings and made a decent return.

Actually shorting (as in selling, not puts) is pretty safe despite what a lot of post January mongoloid believe.,
This is a terrible idea,
Never play earnings. You literally cannot mathematically win. Puts or calls. IVs one son of bitch,
🤣 ....it's definitely  worth a try!!!,
👀 I expect lots of loss porn,
That would be a nice consistent way to lose money,
When you lose it all and work behind a Wendy’s dumpster send me a DM with rates,
It sometimes maybe good sometimes maybe shit,
Here is my strategy for trading earnings:

I don't.,
Stfu,
Lots of shade here, but actually- I bet you can make loot. The key is gonna be good risk  management.  I've said too much though, ill be blasted to fuck all by a lawn gnome for even mentioning risk mgmt any second now.,
This guy is a fucking genius! 
Buy puts!,
Agree, it’s like choosing banker or player on baccarat. You stick to one side only every hand. Comission free baccarat.,
Are base effects finished yet?

Seems like it might take another year or two before those all get washed out.,
Ha, yeah, don't do that,
this is how you jinx the market and now every stock is going to pop off after earnings,
Did u try this with RBLX?,
Shorting earnings is like trimming pubes with a lightsaber,
still havent learned to ignore earnings eh,
this absolutely!

The only company I have seen do well after earnings is a small handful since covid.,
'Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.',
Yolo everything in amc Spiderman nfts instead,
This was literally in the Big Short,
This would be a bit capital intensive,
Fucking great idea!!!,
That’s the play you do when you go with the whole market is rigged….. lmao it’s literally how some top financial institutions make play knowing full well how shuts gonna work out,
I'll call it now. Every pick will definitely have shitty earnings but they'll all inexplicably gap up on them.,
Most companies are massively over valued so investors have insane expectations even when shit meets goals. Really doesn’t matter if they hit targets. I think if you did this in growth stocks, probability wise (don’t just yolo one but do as many as reasonably possible), you may actually end up profitable with this strat,
yea...i remember when pfizer announced that it figured out covid..... then went down and sideways for moths lol,
I tried this on DASH and SPCE and it reamed me,
The ones you short will go up. That’s the law of the nature!,
Great idea. To win money or loose money? What’s the goal here?,
Already tried it. First move I made was shorting doordash on earnings. A sure bet. Literally could not go wrong. I am now in financial ruin,
Roll the dice. Buy quality and add slowly and hold?,
For some odd reason. This is my favorite post of the week. Jesus christ turn off the options my guy or lower the proportion of them. Time and Inflation are a bitch to bet against, but I feel you deeper than any post this month, maybe year.,
Those probabilities May work after infinite trials. How long can you stay liquid.,
The stock market is so stupid that this actually makes sense. You have 75% of winning because you only lose on one scenario out of 4.,
I’ve heard the ‘literally can’t lose money’ far too much and far too many times it’s gone tits up.,
Earnings are priced in.,
Yes,
Call credit spreads got it,
I think it could be a good strategy. Just don't short EV stocks, and tech stocks like nvidia and Microsoft.,
Was my plan to... Thanks nvidia,
I mean yeah. I think he’s onto something. Even if the stocks go up on earnings it’s usually short lived and shorted back down again. Would love to see the results,
Maybe straddle and get out before earnings? You're capped but otherwise at least there's money.,
"PreMarket Gap Up" has entered chat.,
You’re not good at this. Next pls,
There is only one company which deserve this behaviour and that is the retarded Palantir.,
it makes sense because large institutions probably use earnings as a day of liquidity to dump their shares



but nothing really makes sense so,
Tesla would like a word with you. $990 pre earnings, up to $1300 over the next two days.,
This post sounds personal,
“How I made a million doll hairs in stonks in a month and got audited and searched by feds”,
I like to buy lotto puts on stocks that have gone on insane rallies going into earnings. Try to identify the ones most vulnerable to missing based on my own understanding of the market and then roll the dice. It’s a coin toss and the price action is so exaggerated, the payouts can be huge if you hit. This is a super casino.

If you can manage options well, this is better than a real casino by a mile.,
This is legit. Watch DLO, it was already bleeding since September due to being overvalued to the tits, then earnings hit with a "just good" result and it dropped another 20%+ in a day all the way back to IPO price. FUCK. ME.,
If serious, please look up earnings and IV crush. You can get destroyed on options even if it goes the direction you want. There is a way to play earnings, but it’s not what you think.,
This post made my PP hard,
What happens when a company misses earnings while posting horrible losses, then jump 20% cause the CEO used the words "AI" in the conference call in the morning?,
Sounds like another "Sex Panther by Odion" options strategy.

I expected Tattooed Chef to drop on its recent earnings miss; it went up nearly 20%.,
Post position,
Hear me out: Go long the week before and short the day of earnings,
A lot depends on the degree to which you’re right vs wrong. One strong rip to the upside might obliterate your wins. 

A better approach might be to buy weekly calls with some of the proceeds of your short to hedge,
Just buy puts on bad companies but to be honest upst had bad earning and went cuz of Amazon so not a 100%… I think puts on express this week might work this week though,
Might as well just go but it all on black or red, or both then it literally can’t go tits up!,
wow this is almost as smart as my tradeing plan, I buy both SPY calls and puts and I sell the calls when SPY goes uppies and then i sell the puts when SPY goes downies ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275),
I agree. Short the shit out of everything right now the market is a huge scam anyway,
Shorts are very high risk. A safer and not uncommon strategy is to just wait for the inevitable dip and buy low. You can almost always sell the next day when the market's emotion subsides.,
This idea is not insane,
For example, buy a Call and a Put option, per se 5 dollars a pop. Let’s say that it will either go up or down, in this case that option goes to 25$ per option or up. You’ll gain 25$ - 5$ = 20$, which is not bad,
One share,
I think you should save yourself some time and just pick an index to short.,
Short GME,
Was going to short ZM because everyone on here said ZM was going down... Luckily I didn't cause it went up.,
How do you “short stocks”?,
We must be long lost retarded cousins because I had the same idea. I guarantee you a larger percentage of companies go down after earnings but I'm too retarded to compile the data.,

Imagine longing $10 cashing @200 then shorting to $10 then buying it all back with 50x more shares,
So you are saying DWAC will take off to the moon in 4 years?,
Ah what do we have here? Another long term investor.,
Based on the comments here, I am also “retarded” af holding with $61 avg. To the moon LFG! 😂,
Your cell reception is higher than your portfolio average line,
Lol this thing is made out of thin air! Puts all the wayy!,
We got a real life bag holder guys!!! If you didn't see that dwac stock was the definition of a pump and dump then maybe you should get out of stocks cause you are truly retarded.,
Lmao fuck that,
For when you want to show the world your retarded, but in picture form.,
wonder if now would be a good time to pick up DKNG. I mean , sorry to profit off of your pain but I didnt realize DKNG was near a 52 week low!,
What happened to it today? Trading under $37, and suddenly a large buy came in at $6 over market, and they appear to have suspended trading in it for a while...

...or am I reading [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackknife_juggernaut/shares/3Z0R35?) wrong?,
I have full conviction that you’re retarded,
Shitty stock. No earnings. Fuck off.,
It's like a cartoon where the luggage boy at the hotel has the cart piled hilariously high and is trying to navigate the lobby,
Rip 🪦,
Baggie 😂,
last time I had this much conviction in a stock it was PTON last month.   (but I'm still not touching it),
Why did you invest in this? What does this company do?,
R juu estupid…,
These fuckers are so desperate for a win they started buying at almost 70 cents above the bid.,
Your conviction paid off 🥳,
Calls woulda printed. Got a few old shitty ones but 100 before Friday and they print. Surprised no one pumping it on here, low float and a fiendish following this fucker could rocket again,
I mean if trump succeeds in 2024 for a 2nd term this thing is fucking taking off,
DWAC is the play of the decade. there is nothing that can stop this now,
I bought the dip, just a single announcement will get this stock soaring,
Do they even have an office?,
Needs more dwac loss porn like these,
What a joke.,
You cucked yourself,
LMFAOOOOO,
For all I know, Trump is kind of a guy that would sell all his shares for fat profit and just leave everyone hanging. All he cares is money, which he's not even that good at.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
I salute you fellow dwac Ape!,

These deep fakes are getting scary good,
Powell smoking joints and the printer is doing lines,
I'll take your brain to another dimension.
Pay close attention.,
The fact he's not scared scares tf outta me tbh,
Well if Powell pass I puff. You didn't see nothing I know nothing, I just like the stock.,
Bullish on the future of memes.,
Ha! Printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....,
Dank.,
They can print 10 times money. then raise interest rates. That's what the govt and investors love. Bust and boom!,
Hahahahah,

Man, what a waste of time and resources.,
That would be heaven,

When you piss away 20k, god I love this place.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
you have some steel nuts for buying close expiry calls.  The most i would do is buy some leaps for BABA. Not worth the short term shit show for the stock.,
Where is that guy that had 3 accounts on margin with 6 figure loses? Why are there almost no BABA loss porn?

I know you are all out there!!!,
You belong here retard.,
Look forward to seeing your gains tomorrow.. good luck,
You still have 5 more days. GL,
In your previous post, you had $80k from Amzn. What happened to that,
Baba it’s like Amazon on communism.,
F,
RemindMe! December 3rd, 2021, 4 pm EST “check if OP’s calls expired worthless”,
What were you thinking?,
Good luck Babag holder,
Gonna moon.....early January,
Watch BABA fucking rip 20% tomorrow god speed retard,
This is exactly why I bought shares instead,
Bags heavy,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
BABA $240....WISH $20,
I may nibble on some 140Cs today. Just a quick taste, a swirl on the tongue.,
You still have a small chance.. lol,
After you lose money, automatically invest in BABA on a schedule that works for you.,
Sorry to say that these will not print any time soon. China is going through an economic slowdown and that doesn't help BABA in any way. I would long BABA by leaps but waiting for it to hit my PT before  entering.,
BABA Black Sheep Have you any Bags? 

Yes Sir, Yes Sir, Three big Bags.,
Screw baba, lost money on calls and puts multiple months out and as soon as my option expires it starts to move in the direction I needed.,
What the fuck is baba,
Baba to 100,
Thats why you do not invest in China Kids,
RIP that BABA,
Almost there to zero,
Congratulations, you GOTEEEE yourself.,
Bro y tho,
Another one bites the dust. I probably sold you those calls too.,
God speed you mongolo!,
Baba is a tough one. This thing will rip but it may need to dip more.,
Oh no!,
Should've bought Jan calls instead,
Where do these losses actually go? Hedge funds? Retail?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
good luck OP, i'm rooting for ya or meet you behind Wendy's,
What made you think it’s going to surge? Black Friday?,
KOLO, KOLO KOLO, KOLO KOLO, KOLO KOLO TOURÉ, BABA, BABA BABA, BABA BABA, BABA BABA TOURÉ!,
What happened to the retard who bet $10mm into baba at $240?,
I'm with you buddy
We will get there,
Where’s the guy with 1.5m in leaps from when she was at 165?,
Must be the stuff they put in the tap water these days...,
Rip,
Son, is that you?,
Hello, hope you are doing ok. Can you roll it? To further dte?,
Lmao all that ‘research’ you’ve been doing paid off huh? Told you it was a retarded move ✌🏻,
Don’t worry you can lose money in Baba on a schedule that works for you 😂,
Baba black sheep, have you any calls? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.,
My god seeing people still losing money on BABA. If you seek to profit off BABA just... don't. Someone will eventually catch this wave up but the chances it is you are slim. It's oversold yes, but it was for last 5 months. Maybe it will still be next 5 months.. or years? 

There are so many other plays in the market,
Being bullish on a crashing stock in a crashing (chinese) market is as retards as it can get.

RemindMe! 24 hours,
No touchy Chinese stocky while whinnie the pooh acting fucky,

Lionel Groulx station in Montreal :),
Every time I buy it just keeps dipping😔,
I suspect the video cuts off before they start nudging him with their feet.,
It should  end with the doors opening and everyone getting off. Leaving you holding the bags,

GTA \*WASTED\* was seriously needed here op.,
Every time,
Do we all agree Lionel-Groulx is the best designed metro station Montréal?,
"BUY THE DIP OR DIE", the edgy new T-shirt made popular by 17 year olds shopping at Urban Outfitters,
I’m glad to see an accurate representation of my portfolio.,
He really wanted to get home loooooooooooool,
Is he dead?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
My BHG,
Well...on a positive note he made it on successfully.,
That fall out of frame, slightly slouched, gives me vague afro ninja vibes.,
That was our apex ape yoloing at the top.,
Buy the Frito's Bean Dip and lose even more money!,
I thought this was referring how orders don't get filled.

Anyone run into this? Offer market price over and all day nothing,

Hey /u/JohnQx25, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
I’d settle for a reach around,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
I don't remember who it was but the best DD I've read about WISH on here recently was something like:

TICKER: WISH "I wish I never heard about this stock".,
Did WISH pay you to write this?,
#$13 cost basis?  Bag holder identified,
You’re acting like “buy now pay later” is going to drive sales. Every online store or company that I’ve bought from has a BNPL option lol,
Heavy bags,
Seeing the bagholder post with incoherent ramblings and a ton of bolded words months after a run up gives me joy,
I have a better turn around plan: All $WISH bag holder buy anal plugs on $WISH to stop the bleeding, after getting fucked by $WISH. It'll show up on the revenue ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) a long term investor.,
What was it that made wish attractive to so many? Even at this near $1 price I can't find a single reason to even consider buying.... what was the sparkle on this piece of dog shit?,
Remember when Homer Simpson had a fight with the Krusty Burglar?,
Sounds like some last breath before drowning,
To the person who gave this post the "Press F Award" ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Wish will never shake the image of cheap Chinese garbage,
I have 1500 shares,
Well, they turned me around, bent me over, and thrust two fists into my anus.,
You realize their $1b cash is from selling shares and not from operations.  As they continue to burn through cash (was ~1.7b last quarter), wish will eventually need to raise cash again…then what?  Dilution?  Cuz I doubt they have access to the debt market,
Any old time...,
>‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ for its customers

Holy shit, not even the degenerate retards around here so broke they have to buy shit from Wish on credit.,
Wish $20 and BABA$240,
Garbage company. Probably going to .10 cents,
Hmmm where’s the CEO on your exec list? Lmao WISH is a trash fire of a company,
I love when I see posts like this about $WISH,
Why? Covered calls?,
I think $WISH's best turnaround strategy would be the one we use here - inverse their computer monitor with the $WISH graph on it.,
Hahaha get ready for more pounding. Must be humiliating like when I bought LDI at IPO price and it’s down 67%.  ;),
Eat the loss and save yourself some money lol,
They will be bankrupt by the end of 2022.,
You guys still haven't covered and looking for more autists?,
*nobody likes this,
Cut your losses.,
[deleted],
only way this actually turns around is when autists drop their bags.,
Puts on wish. You guys might as well get out now. Wish is going to zero.,

You bought  the plane mid-climb didn't you ?,
That moon, I really felt it yo!,
Haha!  The fire is the icing on the cake!  Lovely metaphor…,
Should have sold the plane to the next fool when it was in the air.,
The accuracy is astounding.,
$WISH upon a star,
Except I was never up,
The wind clipped the tarmac as he pulled up on the nose too hard. Then he punched it hard.,
It's already busted. Might as well hold it now - it is possible in theory that quantum mechanical effects could cause the plane to spontaneously reassemble.,
Should've cashed out on the high but naw you HAD to swing it,
What’s goes up must come down,
Aren’t those planes expensive af?,
The little explosion at the end makes it.,
Did the pilot eject into the ground? 

Because I feel like he did. 
My portfolio ejected into the ground. 
I want it to have company.,
You need to learn when to eject,
But how did that feel when it was shootin’ up?  Hah?  HAH? That’s what we’re addicted to, and there ain’t no escapin’ it.  And I promise you, like a genuine retard - you’re gonna do it again.,
Shouldve pulled,
Oh ho ho, you have no idea how true.,
Oh neat, just like how I lost my virginity,
I appreciated that not only it crashed but it also felt the need to explode just to underline owner’s total failure.,
The pilot belonged in this sub for sure,
lol!!!!,
Fuck yeah.,
I was expecting a parachute after crashing,
I'm not even a fellow crayon eater and this made me belly laugh.

God bless all of you wall street spergs. ❤️,
TL: "It started off slow. Took a few small hits while I was learning to navigate. Then it took off, straight up, and I got higher than I knew how to handle. So I made mistakes and plummeted, crashed, and burned.",
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
I’m there with you bro 😎,
The amount of people in this thread who can’t tell this an RC plane is concerning,
Perfect analogy!,
Same same,
Started with 0, ended with less. Nice,
Truth!,
BRAKE, BRAKE, BRAK.. I mean SELL, SELL!,
*cries*,
If only there was a cliff it could fall off of at the end.,
I’m in this video and I feel personally attached,
Should've sold at the top,
“See ya on the moon, bois!.. Oh fuk.”,
I've taken only 1 out of 2 trades I really liked based on DD from here.  Zillow was @ $100 and I was going to buy $65 puts at around 0.05 per contract.  Didn't do it even though I had a very high conviction.  The next play I did make was puts on Zoom when it was around $250.  Bought at 1.30 / contract $200 by Nov 26th, sold @ around $5.70.,
The fire at the end is you losing all your friends and your mom kicks you out of the basement.,
So you did go up? Wow. That’s impressive.,
Yeah but so fun for a second there that it makes it all worth it right?,
Hey everyone, not sure if I can pin this comment or something, but thanks for all the love on this post. Discovered wsb about this time last year and actually had a good run with gme, love this community and has been a wild ride seeing how this sub has evolved over the shitstorm that was 2021. Much thanks for all the karma, apes! Diamond hands, hodl, ape strong etc, etc…,
It's the explosion after the fact for me,
Me losing half my stimmy money since the start of the year,
Ugh tilray you little shit,
Why was there fire? Lmao.,
🤣🤣,

At least yours went up for a short while,

YEAH,
Diamond hands baby.  Only paper handed ****** would have ejected,
hahahahaha... well that says it all,
Could be worse. You could be hanging out over at r/robinhoodpennystocks. Talk about a stream of bad bets….,
At least yours got off the ground.,
That is how most of my paper aeroplanes go,
Wow, you went up? Nice,
FOR REAL DOG!,
Wait- it went up for a minute there?,
Should’ve sold as soon as it took off. 

Lol. I am just saying for someone else while I didn’t do that myself and huge bag holder since May crash.,
I’m laughing so hard,
LMAO this gave me a good laugh. This is exactly what my short lived options trading experience was.,
The gains hit different on this one,
LOL!,
I feel this in my portfolio,
I bought at the top. The dip just kept dipping.,
Same same,
Definitely could have saved it with more throttle, less stick.,
Ahh yes... Even had the dead cat bounce at the end..,
the explosion in the end made everything perfect,
Ode to my DOGECOIN  stock around the time Elon musk's goes on SNL,
Man I was rooting for you on that lift off.... and then yup.,
It's perfect.,
You guys had a gain?,
That smoke from the fire will keep going up!,
What’s that final blast for?,
Just like the real thing!,
So you broke even, plus gained fire. That’s a win.,
Then you patch it up, throw more money in to it and go again. You buy top of the line FDs, it goes to the moon and you think your a genius.  You use your great found knowledge to yolo into more FDs. Next day your account is down 99%. Rinse and repeat.,
r/2meirl4meirl,
🤣🤣🤣,
💎,
How's you go so high up?,
You aren't wrong,
Seems accurate.,
Just watching the chart…lol,
Well at least it was only a small explosion? Like $10k, hopefully?,
Yes, that lovely feeling of weightlessness at the apex before the crash!,
They didn’t show the part where it went underground though,
Mostly accurate, but really needed a flaming seat ejection to occur once upside down, just to really hammer it home.,
😂,
Should have sold at the top, loser.,
Same.,
Quality shitpost. Take my upvote.,
Wish I could of seen their faces hahahahah,
I've never seen anything more accurate,
This is the way ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
Am I the only one wondering if that was a model or had a pilot whose dead now? Lol,
You're strongly insinuating that you broke even.

I didn't see that jet start tunneling underground...,
I go up when i want to usually with girls that dont want a relationship with me but still... I be up... learn from those who are more apetarded,
You should have been here in 2017. Or whenever we had that lumber company bullshit where I went all in on calls at the height of the squeeze.,
Thanks for the laugh,
Should have pulled at the peak, don't worry, the dive is worth 3k karma.,
The timing of that 💥 was perfect 😂,
I have been watching this for 22 minutes, it is the best thing I have ever seeen.,
I watched this on repeat, laughing to tears. Amazing.,
Went up pretty high tbh,
You have to leverage at the top: 1 plane goes up, 10 planes crash,
[removed],
But it stayed higher than 0??,
You don’t lose til you sell your burning wreckage that will never fly again. Then you lose.,
😂 true well done 👏,  you belong here tbh,
Describe for me your dating life?,
The epitome of crabs in a bucket is this sub.,
I can’t get enough of this,

Hey /u/kiss_the_siamese_gun,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.,
How long did you work on the plane, Brian?

*1000 hours.*

Oh, don't worry mate, you'll come good again.,
😂😂😂 the explosion at the end creased me,
Hahah the explosion at the end defines my strategy beautifully.,
The Russian Air Force has really gone downhill since the Soviet Union collapsed 🤦,
It got pretty high for a second or two,
should've stopped the engine right after the first bounce felt after 1.5 seconds.

Bigger the bounce bigger the fall??,
Mine was more like an advanced drill,
I thought delta wings were only optimized for supersonic speeds,
Yep….,
The fire is buying puts on margin isn't it.,
u/savethisvideo,

It's fine as long as you keep thinking of yourself as Chuck Yaeger when the bastards in charge told him he couldn't go to space.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQt579381OI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQt579381OI),
Mine didn’t even give me the 2 seconds gratification of gains, it just crashed,
That is oddly very accurate in all ways possible.,
Bruh just read the DD bruh,
The moon launch and crash really hits hard,
u/savevideo,
well, it didn't go 500 feet underground, so count your blessings,
Shit mine too lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,
Not gonna lie …. You had me in the first half,
100% the same for me,
There couldn't be a more apt description. The fire was unexpected but it's what sealed the whole experience. Kudos!,
I actually discovered this sub on 1/15.

Opened a TDA account.

Made moves on 1/25.

And yep.,
Tip for you… find what people are pumping on here, add it to a watchlist and watch it everyday till it goes up 30% (probably during pre-market) then short it and watch it fall. There’s no since I buying a stock and waiting for it to go up in a couple months just to watch it fall in a couple of minutes.,
So the pilot’s dead right,
😂😂😂😂😂,
This about sums up every time I try to fly in Battlefield.,
The fireball at the end was a nice touch.,
Bomk,
😂😂😂😂,
Fake af because it didn't burrow 100 ft underground.,
Theres a reason these fighter planes have a massive amount of automatic control systems to keep the plane in the air. Because of stuff like this.,
I can’t believe y’all convinced me to invest fuck all of you,
Why is this so fucking funny?,
😂😂,
Totally me 🤡,
Accurate,
Laughs in freemason,
Did I just watch someone die in flames,
brilliant! made me laugh, thanks!,
The fucking delayed explosion lmao. That's like some cartoon shit,
“Haha we’re all losing money but it’s okay because of some vague sense of solidarity with strangers who won’t pay my very real bills” 

Do You guys like losing? This OG sub was better before the predictable circle jerking, at least insane losses before used to be on some interesting move nobody else was doing.,
That’s a small plane, my friends,
Brutal fake breakout right there,
I do opposite wsb/reddit/meme and been green all year! Even got a couple minor webull awards lol,
this could only be more accurate if the plane tunneled down to the middle of the earth and exploded there,
Mine was more of a > start the engines > IMMEDIATELY EXPLODE < sorta thing,
Pretty much mine but there would also be a dog pissing on it at the end of the video.,
At least you’re sitting at even,
This was an altcoins memeplate months ago. Sad,
Yours went up?,
Crashed and burned, huh Mav?,
oh that's last friday,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
i’ve been laughing for a good 10 minutes just watching this video,
Damn, this hurts me deeply.,
This is such a depressing video

They probably spent so much time on that lol,
How does it fly like this? Is there a storm going on? Or is it just oversteering?,
Nice try Halliburton.,
At least your portfolio has wings, mine apparently do not have any :p,
Shoot for the moon

Literally,
r/thatlookedexensive,
u/savevideo,
They had us in the first half not gonna lie,
Symbolic of Joe Biden’s presidency.,
According to the gif you broke even so I’ll take it.,
That was a very Simpsons-esque explosion at the end. No apparent reason for it to blow up, yet it still does for comedy effect!

Super!,
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,
At least it went up,
I just laughed my ass off haha,
😂😂😂😂😂
Took me one single trade to come to the conclusion that I will NOT use any information from this sub in the future.,
u/savevideo,
u/savevideo,
u/getvideobot,
Couldn't even do it well enough to make a big fireball at the end. Disappointing,

that’s a lot of fancy words for a fella who didn’t include some positions,
Thought this post would be similar to “I am a Dentist….”,
Tl;dr buying Costco stocks,
AAPL 200 3/20,
Lab tech.... Is that like a dish washer that focuses on test tubes?,
In the UK, the BBC news has been dropping hints (for about a week or so) that there's going to be a lockdown before Christmas.

So that's nice.

(Stay safe everyone.),
Zoom and Peloton. Lets go. Bag holding,
What's this real life shit? I only come here to read stories of people losing money on sure things.


Also... good post.,
You can be sure as shit Florida is guna stay open and say fuck you to any restrictions,
As a lab tech who validated the covid antibody test at my state lab, I am hereby inversing you,
report said mild symptom,
“ I'm not saying it'll get as bad as delta, but you can bet your already fisted asses that governments are going to impose a shitload of overreactive (potentially who knows right now) restrictions.”

Delta was heavily publicized as being much worse than it was.  Some will see omicron as crying wolf again.,
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/south-african-doctor-raised-alarm-omicron-variant-says-symptoms/


People (market) don't care about covid unless vaccine don't work or severity is high..

Vaccine working or not? We don't know yet. But pharmaceutical companies will spend 2 weeks and will claim that their vaccine is working or if not working then they will only claim when they have solution already. In short they will not give any bad news because it will hurt their own business.

Just my retarded theory..,
As a lab tech you might want to google "s gene drop out" whith omicron. With the standard pcr test only one subttest is negative. Meaning that it can be detected by the behaviour in a standard PCR and does not necessarily need sequencing. Depending on proper testing and reporting it can be detected much easier.,
Severity data is all that matters.,
Having once been a lab tech, I don’t think that means anything other than being fairly broke in a dead end job. Lab techs don’t know anything,
Reports are already coming out that omicron symptoms are mild. It's insane that this tanked the stock market this easily. We are living in clown world. However a good dip is always a buying opportunity.,
Omicron : oh my carona,
#*Florida and Sweden have entered the chat*,
I think it’s highly likely we see some of these announced January return to office plans pushed out just like how delta changed the mass labor day targets out,
It’s mild af,
Starscream variant when?,
Hey guys, he’s a lab tech!

See?  Nobody cares.,
Everyone back in your cells… 2 weeks to flatten the curve.,
Brain too smooth wat Covid stonks…,
None of this shit matters,  all that we care about is how severe the illness is.    If it's minor, like the doctor that discovered said it was, this is what we used to call "A Cold"

Now you have states like NY going into emergency mode without knowing any facts.   So stupid.,
Fuck COVID. Let the dumb people die. Stop saving everyone. Open the casino!,
So the VIX, credit volatility index looks a lot like it did before the march 2020 crash. Just sayin',
Novavax is coming,
Been here for weeks and yet we’re all fine 🤡 SPY 500 EOW retard,
Nah, man. Everything is back to normal. The gov needs people to make/earn money. Let's go!!!,
Lucky "they" dont have to manage a war, looking at the way they manage covid, we would be in deep deep trouble....., pitiful.,
Because it’s more than likely already widely spread, shutting down borders is useless.  Look how shutting down borders in 2020 worked.  It still spread like wildfire.  Quit shutting down the world and bite the bullet.,
[removed],
For the stock market new restrictions might be positive as it gives the fed an excuse to ramp up QE again.,
Fuck Covid. I’m fully vaxxed and if we lockdown again I’ll be out with the crazies protesting.,
Who the fuck cares?,
They already said mills symptoms. The stock market will rally.,
It's been showing to have very mild symptoms so I don't think it'll end up being a big thing,
So to sum it up there’s nothing that can be done about it so governments should just let us continue to live our lives and let Omicron run its course like the rest of the variants 🤷‍♂️,
New name, same BS.,
So what you’re saying is, they have no way to realistically test all Covid positive cases for which strain it is, and will now call all new Covid positive tests as Omicron and keep the fear train rolling? 
Boo$ters for everyone!,
They’ve known about it since the 9th of November,
Money printer go brrrr which means everything goes up,
Don’t know what you just said, but I’m hard as a rock.,
Fuck Corona 👋🏻,
Working in an ER in NJ. Can confirm, the uptick in cases has been staggering.,
I love how China built entire hospitals in two weeks to care for covid patients, but we’ve been quarantining and locking down instead to prevent hospital overload for close to 2 years. Absolute clown world.,
Imagine living in a place that would still consider doing covid lock downs. In OKC the pandemic has been over for a year and everyone has moved on with their lives.,
What would happen if there was a real pandemic, like the Black Death plague in Europes 14th century. That killed off 50 percent of the population. Think about that for a sec, Covid is a fraction of 1 percent,
Get vaccinated.,
I thought you were going to say something useful. "We might lockdown" is not useful jnfo, tell me a about the virus,
Lab tech.. hmm. How well do you know this bug? On the inside.. my hypothesis is that the virus will be like all the earlier variants. My anology is the spike protein is just a key to your house but the thief just does thief thing. So as long as the key is changing without changing the content, most people will survive. Most compromised respiratory ppl either dead or vaccinated to exhibit lessor severe response.,
Appreciate your post OP.

I wrote a DD about the variant and what makes it stand-out. I'm a former professor who loves to make walls of text about nerdy things and politics.

Also adding comments over the weekend to track places where they've found it (which I agree with OP, this shit is probably everywhere already).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2t901/nu\_variant\_who\_catalyst\_spy\_yang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2t901/nu_variant_who_catalyst_spy_yang/)

One thing I'd add in addition to PTON and ZM and so forth is MRNA, BNTX, PFE, and any other vaccine plays. Particularly the mRna makers MRNA/PFE as they've both issued statements about creating a new booster specific to Omicron (they haven't don't that for any other variants).,
Lol delta wasn’t even bad... actually none of it has been bad haha insanely high survival rate and efficiently and effectively treatable with a couple common medications ... it was a money grab and power grab.,
No,
NOT TO MENTION...BIDEN TRANSPORTED ILLEGALS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES...UNTESTED AND NATURALLY UNVACCINATED...I KNOW FOR A FACT HE DID THAT..MY DAUGHTER WAS APPROACHED BY THEM IN AUBURN IND.,
Dude the symptoms are literally a mild cough for a day or 2 and feeling tired……,
Vaccines still protect from hospitalizations, so no major difference in impact as delta. Eventually the unvaxxed will all inoculate or die.,
What are the best COVID stocks at this point?,
Trust me I’m a doctor,
This was the best time to buy dumbbells on sale for cyber Monday and sell your old ones when this shit is more rampant. 

Good post OP,
Just another propaganda campaign to drum up fear so you all gets your boosters and jab your kids. Pfizer likes your money. Govts gonna shit their pants and tell everyone to freeze like a game of red light green light. Classic govt style. Keep doing all the same shit that doesn’t work right out of the cya handbook,
Omicron has by far the coolest covid name yet so buy as much stock as possible fucking losers,
You realize this will never end, this is nothing to do with any virus.,
Covid is a scam. Next slide,
The Covid tester I went on a date with lied to me about vaxxed when they had the first opportunity to, and said it wasn’t that bad. I’m going ignore the fuck outta this post,
[removed],
I wash dishes at a restaurant so I can have knowledge of being a chef.   GTFO,
Big scam like covid was spy 500 eow,
Thanks Jrrr,
[removed],
The omicron variant is apparently extremely mild even for the unvaxxed, for vaxxed a complete non issue. 

Everything is going back to the moon.,
Rearrange the letters ‘omicron’… search ‘oncomir’ and ‘moronic’… tell me they are not laughing at us!,
it seems like its gonna be another delta wave. that didnt really slow much down.,
As a lab tech, most of what you said in your post is way outside of your realm of expertise and is about as valid as the opinion of a fast-food worker, like me.,
It’s a light cough.  It’s the FUD varient,
It’s another push for control. Might as well make some money off it.,
The current vaccines widely available work against this omicron variant too,

unless the virus will replace itself with a boring variation and no one wants a jab against something that only makes u a bit tired and sore.,
Let’s be honest; this stock will be profitable for the foreseeable future. I don’t see this virus ever going away until it’s viewed like the flu.,
OP, you are correct. About everything. Well said.,
Wouldn’t say they hustled…..omicron saved them,
Moderna going to $694.20 soon. $1000 by march 2022,
It's sad to say. Monday Moderna drop back to 260,
moderna is the macafee antivirus of its day what a scam release a virus sell you protection you need to buy update every 6 month,
Yes.,

Decaf coffee makes no sense,

Long SPY at 470

By long I mean December 8th,
Trading options really taught me how in the grand scheme of things, 50k really isn’t that much 

But putting that 50k into options…what an orgasmic rush, either you’re rich and retire that same day or you put on your black Nikes and go back to work at McDonald’s,
Felt cute, might lose money later,
I chase money knowing deep down, even if I were to make millions, I'd probably still feel just as empty on the inside as I do now. Just a lost soul looking for peace in this life.,

If majority of people know omicron is a joke why are the bears expecting another drilling 😂😂😂,
While so many on The Street were rushing out to buy ammo, toilet paper, and canned goods on Friday, I was buying some unbelievable dips. My moves tomorrow? Watching my portfolio increase, of course.,

MRNA calls boutta print so f’n hard,
SPY +2% confirmed.

Thanks Israel, this is why the Christian right loves you!,
Bruh, experts are already downplaying omicron saying it's only mild and that a vaccine will be rolled out to counter it. Ain't no one scared of this shit and this knee jerk reaction by the media was uncalled for. There's no way we aren't up tomorrow,
A Monday open hasn’t felt like a coin flip this much in a very long time. Really have no idea which way we’re going.,
If tech doesn’t go up this week I will have blown up my account for the 19th time,

Watch spy moon and DIS continue to gape my asshole like every other trade I make.,
rip in piece tomorrow to the geniuses who "inverse wsb bullish sentiment", buy puts, and get absolutely wrecked.,
Worst fear is hearing "Hello, I’m John Quiñones from What Would You Do" after telling someone in front of me in the store that they'd be able to pay their groceries if they were a retard on WSB,
I finally have a day where I can sleep in with 0 worries. Got shares and some leaps. Don't have to babysit any short term calls. Got fucked enough the past 2 weeks. Good luck fella's I'm getting them quality Zzzs,

Good stock if your trying to shed net worth going into a divorce. Terrible in every other regard,
[deleted],
It was a pump and dump that destroyed a lot of people on this sub.,
No one has made money on it so why would anyone like it?,
>ipo’d roughly a year ago at like $24 and has been on a downward trajectory since

Answered your own question. A bunch of people lost money in the early rugpull / pump and dump, and now everyone is salty about it.,
Which company exactly is shittier?,
Probably overexposure on this thread. People were sick of seeing it.,
It went down.,
I'm a buyer around tree-fiddy,
Because a buncha retards thought they could pump it; despite there being literally nothing good about the company. And there's still a buncha bagholders trying to hang on. 

I know we're not exactly into fundamentals here but we should at least understand that when there're memes about how shitty a company is, it's a pretty shitty company.,
It’s a shitty company that sells shitty products and has a shitty management team. How is this fucking complicated?,
Sounds like a bag holder post to me!,
Firstly there aren't that many more shitty companies on this sub, but secondly it happens to every meme stock once the hype is over, once most of the bagholders have accepted their fate.,
Maybe because it went to 3$,
99% of people who put any money into this stock have lost, and lost a ton of money. People don’t like losing money.,
There were tons of posts several months ago pumping this stock up for the inevitable dump. People hate it because they lost money on it and fell for the trap.,
Have you ever bought anything from Wish?,
Most of the favorite companies of this sub are somewhat legitimate. Tesla, AMD, Palantir all doing good job, unlike wish,
Haven't you heard their earnings call in the last quarters? Nothing at all is positive:

- Revenue decline.
- MAUs decline.
- cash burning every quarter.
- etc.,
Uh, its stockholders are down 30-80%.  I think that will answer your question.  Plus they sell awful, deceptive shit and nobody wants awful, deceptive shit.,
People prefer having money to not having money.,
They didn’t make enough crayons, so goes down.,
We've all had the experience of gambling on wish, shoes that don't last a day, video cards pulled out of the trash claiming to be top tier... You name it.,
Because bag holders keep shitposting "I'm just asking questions!",
From what I saw, it seemed some were pushing it à la pump and dump AFTER the initial bad bet wager posts began.  A few got behind it and the cycle began.,
Wsbers bought the dips and now they are bagholders who can't let go and are here pumping a garbage stock relentlessly.,
They have no CEO. At least the biggest wagered stocks on here (AMC, GME, CLOV, etc) all have terrific management guiding the ship. Wish has literally nothing going for it. It’s not a sleeper stock that wall street is ignoring, it’s not being manipulated, it’s just trash that uneducated traders pumped.,
It is literal garbage. It’s amazon for defective Chinese knockoff merch,
You want to see hated?

Talk crypto....,
Ppl rolled into wish after Gme...they thought it was gonna hit big and they lost everything.,
Wish is fucking trash. 50-60% of orders never arrive. Their products are more than often not what is advertised, it's like if Amazon was a meth addict. Stop praying that wish's ticker is going to make it for you, pull out on the slightest rise and never touch it again. End. Of. Story. It's not even a good meme stock. Yeah, it sucks that bad.,
The furu who called amc said wish would hit 69 when it was around 9. So a lot of low level iq yolo chasers bought and held without doing any DD,
I don’t hate WISH. I hate CLOV with a passion though.,
It was fun when it's volatile and people made money.  
Now it just slides down and the only ones who cares are bag holders.  
The rest of us wants something fresh as usual.,
‘Historically celebrated’…how so? This is a casino, just cus some with too much change can afford to dump into shitty stocks doesn’t mean everyone should follow. You chugged the meme koolaid; people who did their research or ordered their products were bashing wish from the start. but others just screamed wish to the moon!, and  the masses followed. When the rocket was crashing those that were losing their money woke the fuck up and joined the bash train.,
Simply because it's created some of the world's greatest loss porn. Turned millionaires into thousandaires and thousandaires into Wendy's off-book employees,
I heard dollar 25 tree stocks are heading in the same direction.,
I've been very pleased with most of the stuff I've bought from Wish, things mostly like guitar strings, picks, capos, tuners.  Also cannabis supplies, solar powered lights, etc.  


Common sense would tell you not to buy shoes there...I guess not.  


One huge problem with Wish is that their interface is freaking awful in that you have to click and click and navigate quite a bit before you find out what the actual price of the item.  It's frustrating and usually I just walk away from the site without buying anything, even leaving stuff in my shopping cart unpurchased.  


Making something a hassle to buy is the kiss of death for a retailer, and making a difficult website is especially bad.  I wouldn't buy their stock with your money.,
WISH gonna bounce back!,
I’d say it’s either hedgies trying to scare you off because wish is about to be bought by baba or Amazon and get back in the 30’s. But really it’s so fucking cheap right now. I also thought it was cheap at 6 lol


Wish if you can hear me do something.,
That's some next level bag holder rant,
Its an all around shit company that I was more than happy to place puts once I could see the momentum end. There is a ton of bag holders who thought it could actually go somewhere like gme or amc and thats why its so hated,
It's a garbage company, but it's approaching oversold territory, and it might get a meme pity-pump at some point, so it would be wise to buy a few lotto OTM long dated calls while it's cheap.,
Cuz wish is an awful company… you could order a new phone on there, and they would ship you a potato… then they have nonexistent customer support so you are stuck with a potato,
Would never buy anything from Wish again. Fking, shitty company.,
It’s a great stock if you’re shorting it 🤣🤣🤣,
I downloaded the wish app like a year ago and bought some chinese piece of shit for $1. I don't even remember what it was, just that it was basically free. 

It never showed up. I figure all that I got was my name and address on some PRC watchlist.,
Shitty company with shitty products. They are getting sued by multiple lawfirms now for essentially lying/ inflating metrics during their ipo, massively overprices ipo,  Insiders are dumping massive amounts of shares week after week, ceo just stepped down(i hate companies where management screws over retail investors)revenue going down, mau going down, burning through cash(probably another offering in a year or so)..no leadership and absolute trash management…fake followers on social media(go check their fb page, 39+ million followers and they barely get 100-200 likes per post)…there is genuinely nothing to like about this company.,
I was super confused how it got traction to begin with. Everybody knew they were a trash ripoff scam company. Even by WSB standards, I consider it worst than AMC, GME, or even DOGE.,
I have stopped using Wish since 2018. My wife used to order lots of stuff but the stop was due to their quality and leading time. Otherwise, liked some of the cheap products. Lol.,
Because everyone is done 50+ percent,
Please refrain from ever sharing your opinion again, with anyone, for any reason, ever,
Because everything sold by WISH sucks, including their stock. On a serious note though, there are probably a lot of salty bagholders who hate it, and even more people who just like to make fun of it.,
Because the moment it became a thing, likely by citadel shills, it has been shorted to oblivion,
It probably fell out of favor when it took all their money…could just be the really gay name though idk,
Go buy something from wish and get back to us OP.,
People get tired of a stock that has been constantly pumped but only goes down. Wait till the stock is in an uptrend and then you’ll see a different reaction (maybe).  Doesn’t matter what wsb thinks really…the stock price movement is all that’s needed to understand the sentiment around the stock.  Don’t fall into the trap:  a cheap stock doesn’t mean the company is cheap,
It just has that Luckin Coffee vibe,
Please refrain from asking a question and then answering your own question.,
Blazing new roads in e commerce? Boy the only thing keeping wish alive are people buy the crap from there to do YouTube videos. It’s American Ali express,
Coz it doesn't come with a genie to make the wish cum true,
I'm going to guess people lost lots of money,
Risky bets, yes. Absolutely retarded bets on crappy stonks, no.,
cause people who never bought anything from the site started thinking it's the dollar tree of e-commerce. 

Also at one point it did have a valid short interest and volume for ideal squeeze. 

Everyone's still looking for the next GME/AMC squeeze.,
A whole bunch of pumpers and dumpers writing DDs every week gets irritating fast!,
I just assumed a bunch of people lost money on it and hate it because of that,
It’s like, buy something for way less than it should be. It never arrives. You forget about it because you were hammered. Free money. Smart business if you ask me. Very little overhead.,
Real answer: because it was at one point a meme stock. Just like many other meme stocks, it was pumped, went from about $8 to $14. the problem is, that was it. It had a single pump solely off of wsb retards thinking everything was a short squeeze, and then it continued falling as it always has been. 

For some reason, this stock got a shit ton of attention on this sub when it was popular, and pretty much everyone who didn't get out during the unexpectedly short pump lost money (it had ridiculous price targets, and the highest it reached around that time was only around $14) 

We all lose money here, but wish is a special one where almost everyone who played it lost money, including most option holders since the price kept falling but never enough to make puts profitable.

The real winners of $WISH are theta gang,
I shorted the shit out of that stock when I saw all the bs products on Facebook ads. It’s a pos company and heavily shorted. Hoping it continues to go bust!!,
Your asking why everyone is bent out of shape about wish look at all the loss porn on wish.,
going down constantly didn't help it any...,
Whenever I think of Wish I imagine a white fuzzy retarded monkey like creature.    Google, Images, “Wish Meme” and you’ll see what I’m talking about.,
Because it’s a bad stock that actually went down. Here, only bad stocks that go up are celebrated. At the end of the day, profits over everything.,
You really need to stop buying every stock that gets pumped here, while it's getting dumped lol,
Never like the company or the stock,
Bc it’s literally garbage like their products are a meme almost. Who would invest money in this shit. It’s not hated it’s just mind boggling,
Because Wish is actually trash. The products are misleading, sometimes they send the wrong thing, some times they dont send anything, cloths sizes are wack, everything is cheap, it is basically a scam that is just good enough to not be considered a scam by people that think they are getting good deals. Ive bought maybe 4 or 5 orders from Wish and was not happy once. My mom somehow uses wish and has the "ehh its cheap" mentality. I will never use Wish again. When I heard they were going to IPO my first thought was who the fuck would invest in such a bad service,
Because the people in this subreddit are lazy and greedy gamblers lmao so when they get played by companies or hedge funds because they don’t make great decisions, well that might rattle some feathers. The old days of actually tryna put up a fight in the market as a collective group died a while ago.,
Cuz it’s shit.,
Lots of bagholders i imagine,
Just go on Glassdoor and see the employee feedback.  It’s run by idiots.  Fucking joke of a company. No way will this garbage turn around till they gut all managers from Director on up.,
The first WISH DD I read hear had a comment where someone simply stated the number of APP downloads was drilling....

Can't grow your company when no one is downloading the APP to use your company.

Note: I do not, and have never had, any positions in $WISH.,
It had some fucked up earnings the last 2 quarters.  I think people expected it to get to the IPO price at the least but they shit the bed 2nd half of the year pretty bad.  

Most shitcos you can make a case for, but with such dogshit earnings no one should touch WISH with a 10 ft pole - I think it’s bottomed out here but might take a long time to move up though,
Because everyone lost money with it dammit,
Cuz it's Chinese garbage Nott to mention takes 3 months to receive said garbage,
Look at their website and you will know why it sucks.,
Pretty sure you answered your own question in the opening sentence lol,
People are smug assholes who want to shit on others. That is, when they’re right. If wish went up it’d be the other way around.,
That is not what this sub historically celebrates sounds like you joined in January,
As a partial owner of WISH, how dare you...,
Some people are shorting it and wanting to spread the hate to make the company goes to as low as possible. Some lost money on are and now is venting.

Being amazon's competitor and all, Amazon could be hiring a number of people to spread bad rumor too. Normally they would be selling shits at a loss but wish is too strong to be crushed normally I guess.

Honestly the reason doesn't matter though. With all these hates and, maybe, a lot of enemies, Wish won't go anywhere. If you are still betting on the company I'd suggest you make some adjustment to your position. Betting on wish is, like, betting against reddit and against Amazon itself now.

Have you taken a look at Amazon's competitors? They never did well. Never bet against Jeff. That should be clear by now.,
Because it is genuinely a garbage company,
That stock will make you a millionaire.


If you are already a billionaire,
Cheaply made products,
I’ve been talking shit about WISH from day 1. I think the real question is how did it even become popular in the first place?

I think the answer is obvious. People liked the ticker name and did 0 dd.,
do you understand how many ppl had unjustified high hopes for $WISH? and how many millions of dollars have been lost on the stock on this sub? $WISH is like that kid born with every advantage and still manages to become a colossal fuck up. 

edit: I’m not one of the retards that lost money on it,
Well I hate their platform, their products and their customers. So without looking at the financials I already hated the stock too.,
People still salty they're holding the bag on a shit company.,
You get can better products from a dumpster,
WISH's deals are so good even their stock is 80% off.,
open the app and see for yourself. have you ever bought anything from wish btw?,
I assume its because anything bought on "wish" is garbage.
You would have more more rewarding consumer experience setting your own money on fire.

As people learn this they realize they can make puts on wish and burn ALOT more cash and feel warm and nice.,
How it became hated? It tanked /thread,
Op's account name says it all,
Who has a cost basis of 30+ 🤔,
Cuz it fucked so many in the ass n then got its own ass banned in europe total shitshow stonk,
my $wish stock went from $8.49 to $11.60 so i was up quite a bit. but the second time i bought it it plunged. I'm just glad i havent bought more. down $1000 now.,
We don't hate it, we're just bag holding.,
Because we all had a huge loss making a wish BS.,
Iirc people werent originally betting on shitty companies. They were betting on truly undervalued good companies due for a breakout, or at least what they thought were good and due. Meme bets didnt come in until much later. Hell, there was a time where yolos were up for being banworthy because it was ciewed to undermine the spirit of the sub.

But as far wish itself goes, its hated because its a geniunely garbage company that repeatedly gets pumped here.  Its the "Reefer madness" of stocks.,
Account age 9 months, thinks he knows what's historically celebrated on this sub,
lmao all your posts are crying about how bad wish is doing, and you still don't get it?

shitty companies are talked about here on the prediction that they're undervalued/over-shorted and due to have a (perhaps short-lived) run. in wish's case the prediction was wrong, and they're just a shitty company.,
company in the tech world that is actually SHRINKING in every metric, and last 2 quarter topline HALVED... 

perpetually losing money.  all the revenue is offset by SGA.

WISH is just a vehicle for the executives to get paid in stock and dump it on retail. 

CEO made $100M in 2020, from a topline of <2B lol.  their pay structure uses a peer group of Twitter, Shopify, Palo Alto Networks, Wayfair, Square.... as if theyre anywhere comparable to those companies,
WISH is run by clowns. I've recently gotten ads from wish and they cant even convert from USD to NOK properly in their ads. USD to NOK is smth like 1:8 exchange rate, but they seem to be using smth like 1:50...,
I invested like $20 in WISH by buying pants from their app with about 20-30 pictures of Putin's face all over them.

Best investment.,
Lol even Nikola is performing better than Wish,
The boss and I are playing a game at work. Who can diamond hand their bags the longest. Dear God, help us.,
>Any mention of WISH is absolutely tarred and feathered here now. Why is this?

Lot of people got burned holding the bag. If it were currently at $25 we would be talking a different story and everyone would be touting it as the best thing ever. Stocks are spit on when they drop and praised when they rise. This is the way.,
Op is creating FUD . BAD MOUTHING WISH . COME ON STOCKS GO UP AND DOWN .,
Shut the fuck up bitch. Buy the dip, pussy,
I’m confused as how “buy anything from wish” is not a good answer. Seems like that would be a top answer for any stock you bought.,
What's the short float? And something with their European market where France banned it,
I’m down 70% but I’m too retarded to sell now.  Waiting to be down 99%.,
I'm still bag holding $WISH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Please give me some love ...,
Well where do I start. Non curation of seller products. Almost useless refund policy. Shit on the site barely work past the first week when you get them if u could even use them at all. Facebook ads with obvious scams I mean what the fuck.

I have gotten a lamp off a street market in beijing that still works today so dont even try with bruh their shit is made in china.,
No one it coming to take your bags off you my guy.,
Buy Puts and you will make $$$ off of wish 89% of the time,
Wish $ 24 and Baba$240,
You’ll WISH you hadn’t.,
Stocks like AMD and NVDA were *historically* celebrated on this sub. WISH was "celebrated" because of an influx of about 2mil in 2020 and another 8-9mil in Jan 2021, and everyone new was trying to get rich off ipos and spacs that hockey stick'd in January. And they've been bag holding ever since.,
I wish people would stop talking about this shity stock bad fundamentals and investing in any Chinese company is bat shit crazy look at what just happened to didi,
It was a zack moris / atlas trading pump. Why would anyone like it?,
Like asking why WeWork is disliked.,
Even if were a private company I would still find a way to bash it.,
I love how i have been calling this from the start. I wonder if people here are still falling for melvin capital stocks bots, or if you guys actually have a hand for picking the most retarded stocks all by yourselves.,
Wish has potential idgafwys,
What makes you think it's hated?   I think the only stocks we hate are the ones we never talk about.     If anyone hates a stock, they hate the fact they made a bad trade on it lol,
Because so many here only read the good stuff posted by others who only post the good stuff. When shares were $14 someone posted they were going to buy 5000 shares for ~$70k, I suggested buying at the money calls for ~$2-$2.50 and 50 (5000) shares cost ~$10k you see where the stock is, he saved close to $60k.  Most responses were far from polite, oh well,
Because it keeps drilling....,
OP is a WISH insider LOL!,
If the stock loses money there can’t be much love for it,
Number get smaller. Dollars go away. We no like.,
Its a pump and dump scheme. There was never any fundamentals or plan; you overpaid for a piece of trash. Dump now and never look back

&#x200B;

\> But even if it is a crappy company with a crappy product, aren’t stocks like that historically celebrated in this sub?

I celebrate **UNDERVALUED** companies,
There's like one dude on here that made money on that trash.  Everyone else lost money on that POS stock.,
investing in wish is like a being a underclassman in JV vs Varsity scrimmage, your just there to build someone’s confidence,
For me I think it’s because it’s a pump and dump. The company makes no money and is burning through money. Remember when all the memes were about uber being a black hole. Second bag holders are constantly posting in here flooding the sub annoying people. Lastly this sub loved undervalued stocks and at one point people took that as any dumpster fire stock. I hate to see this because real people chasing the WSB dream dump their life savings in these trash stocks losing it all.,
Bunch of people not plugged in enough to meme culture to understand that WISH was a joke. Entire youtube subcultures of "look at this scam / weird / counterfeit product on WISH lmao",
Hahaha I made money on WISH… gave the money to my wife’s boyfriend,
[removed],
Trash counterfeit goods,
>I always thought the spirit of the sub was based on outrageous wagers on either unrealistic expectations of good stocks, or betting huge on shitty stocks.

In those cases someone presents a thesis on how the company will change or have big news soon. Whats the thesis on wish?,
Because everyone lost money with wish, duh!,
lol, I actually made 1k with +20% on wish, selling right before the downfall to oblivion,
Bag holders.....,
Wish will make you a millionaire, if you are a billionaire.,
It was so blatantly a P&D, and the artificiality and ubiquity of the shilling…I think a lot of people felt insulted.,
Anybody who has ever bought and held WISH since it went public is currently down on it. That’s why everybody hates it and if your employer doesn’t, you’re interning at the wrong place,
Cause they a bunch of commies.,
Have you used that app? Shit is trash,
I enjoyed going to the theater even with the old prepopped popcorn and I enjoyed going to GameStop when I was young. Wish is only fun for the moronic ads full of weird sex toys. The part where they send people even worse stuff when they buy things is extra icing on the no-thanks wish.,
Anyone whos been in this sub before the January GME influx knew what WISH was. As always P&D,
Wish is now $3.50, I see a lot of tax write offs coming veryyy soon,
I accidentally bought in on WISH some time ago based on some DD and advice on this sub, then after buying I started reading some reviews from facebook about WISH and realized I had made a terrible mistake, there were basically only negative reviews. Luckily got out on the first chance without loss.,
Because it’s a wiSHIT company… you see the whole GameStop backing theory was cuz of short interest and hedge fund greed… same with AMC. 
At least many stock holders and common people had good experiences with either AMC or Gamestop…
But what value does wish hold ? To irrationally bet huge amounts of hard earned money ? 
While it may seem that everyone here are dumbos thinking others are dumbos and try taking advantage of each other, the reality is that most people on here are smart… 

Tldr: Wish!=GMe/Amc…

My sympathies if you are bagholding with wish…,
Because it's on WSB and it's 💩💩💩💩💩 alright 
Who believe  anything WSB LMAO
SHILLS AND BOTS 
PUMP AND DUMP,
Cause apes are dumb asf here, me included. We bought the stock after it was hyped up to the moon, only to lose our trendies. It’s a shitty company anyway. Pt > 1.00 $ then maybe I’ll buy some stock.,
Because wish sucks donkey dick.,
I'm sure it will have a resurgence when it gets down to $2 sometime next year. There's been zero support for it at any price level. The only thing they got going for them is cash on hand, but burning through cash while losing customers is not going to inspire anyone.,
I actually dont think there are shittier companies out there though.,
It was a Zack Morris pump and dump,
I'm a long term investor 🤡,
Everyone who buys WISH doesn’t like money,
You can still bet yuge on wish. and other shitty stocks. I did. Bought a crapton of puts.,
It’s not just that it’s a shitty stock. It’s also a tremendously shitty company. That’s like a daily double.,
They only existed because of predatory advertising and tracking of users.  They deserve to be hated, no different than Facebook, or Google should got their invasive manipulation of user behavior.  They died once apple turned off the spy machine, I hope they go bankrupt with everyone who supported them.,
China stocks all suck. Enough said.,
This guy WISH stock’s,
They built it up, now they take it apart. Climbed up real high, then fell down real far.,
Run far away if you WISH!,
I don’t know if you researched anything on this dumpster fire but they deliver a shit product that isn’t even theirs, the products are typically pirated and phony, and they contain chemicals and material that are harmful to the end user. On top of that they are banned in France and I think England because of they’re dangerous product. But I have to check on the England part. 

And that doesn’t even cover the logistics and that they’re a Chinese based company that gets fucked by the government over there 🤷🏻‍♂️,
I don’t hate WISH at all. It’s obviously a terrible company and I would never, ever invest in it, but it’s provided lots of great loss porn for this sub, which makes me happy.,
People hate it cause poo stock and company,
I fucking hate WISH so much!,
Wish in one hand. Shit in the other.  Congrats. You have two hands full of shit,
I think it sucks. The products are crap.,
It's going back up to $20 after the reverse split.,
No penny stocks, please,

House prices will rise...really it depends on your location I guess,
i'm a broker and rates were creeping up the last two weeks, and now the prime is back to 2.825%.  it basically follows the 10-year T bond; if it is above 1.5% the rates will rise, below and they will fall.  10 year's were trading at like 1.4xx on friday on Omicron news so they lowered, but still not as low as a month ago.,
Of course rates are gonna drop - they want to incentivize as many as possible to buy now before the home market crashes.,

FU they were pumping market crash articles now pumping 10% pump article. U business insiders are no better than CNBC u 🤡,
10% by 2022, isn’t that the exact standard yearly return for the s&p?,
Soar over 10% in 13 months?

Come on bruh we're here for 10% in 13 minutes.,
yee-haw  
no one cares,
Breaking news: different people have different predictions,
Wow another 500 points on the SPX this year, holy shit what a fucking move. Next you'll tell me this guy's IQ will soar above 80,
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Puts on McDonald’s,
Not currently looking this the 2k call for that august?,
TSLA currently at 2.5x that price, you could have just kept buying TSLA calls and youd be banging hookers and doing cocaine right now,

What did yall expect? You never get what  you expect when you buy from Wish.,
I definitely stepped on the shit too,
One time I shit myself in a bush outside of a post office, even then I felt more sane than someone who supports buying Wish.,
"It's the next GME" lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Astoundingly accurate!,
Down 87.43%,
So what happened that made y'all realize the company that sold absolute shit was not a smart investment?,
Always heard that if wsb is negative on go all in! I did the retard move,
Wish bagholder here. Yeah that hurt good,
I still believe is undervalued but I sold everything as checking charts trending down was too depressing,
When wallstreetbets is doing a pump and dump you don't try to hold it long term.  You take your profits and move on to the next one,
Lol good one! 😂,
I'm actually surprised it never took off like GME and AMC. It had everything to be the next meme stock. A shitty business model, a decreasing customer pool, poor leadership and probably the best ticker symbol.,
It’s the next Amazon!,
Are you telling me to buy more stocks from it???,
It’s done nothing but gone down…is now a buying opportunity? 👀,
Buying wish, is like buying Amazon stock on wish.com,
What made you madmen actually put some money into this dogshit?,
Hey don’t forget Vinco Ventures,
I stepped in that shit,
Wish tanks because all of the tankers are at sea,
Even then, so many people visit that site and buy the crap it sells.,
I’m only down about $500 on wish. I consider myself lucky in comparison to some others on here who went in too deep,
You take that back! It's primed and set to launch! 🚀🚀🚀

/s,
Lucky for shoes although barefoot is legal,
OH CHET 😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,
One of the most fucking funniest thing I’ve seen so far on Reddit😂🤣,
Is that Zack Morris? FTP,
The way I see it my 20 $12 calls  expire in 530 days or so. If I sell them now, I'll only get $300, so I'll hold and see what happens lol,
This sub is so retarded. Six months ago you all were creaming over this stock.,
Why you gotta insult shit like that.,
I ordered a single item from them on the 17th and it won’t be here till the 10th of Dec lol. This company sucks.,
In my experience wish stepped on me and stole a small fortune,
All in on CRSR. They will actually have an earnings this quarter, unlike this shitwhole site (wish),
That shoe is going to come apart in a week,
Next Amazon,
I got that shit on my shoe too …. I ain’t gonna wash it off though … I am a tard … I kind of like it!!,
Warren Buffett once said he only buys companies that he himself would actually use.  Thats why hes balls deep in stuff like Coke and Mcdonalds.  

Id never use Wish unless it was for a gag gift.  It sells literal garbage.

Wht anyone would invest in that platform is beyond my comprehension,
Is that Zack Morris?,
Took 600 dollars  for me to wash that shit off,
I bought it and that was one and only thing I would buy involving wish. Absolute junk,
I’m the only one who never bought any of this shit,
You can shit in one hand and wish in the other, which hand will fill up faster?,
Replace wish with clov,
Go Ape at zero,
Big fax,
Gross,
LOL,
I was expecting to see my name then portfolio behind it.,
Hey you gonna finish that ?,
Governments hate this WISH lose deduction tax cheat,
Lol after buying something from wish I would never ever ever invest in that company,
I'm wishing my bets bring profit. If not, I go double down until my wishes go true.,
"bUy tHe dIp" (anytime you read this, it applies),
Spot on, ... ... my shoe!,
Still holding my $5 put 🤑🤑🤑 going to sell 30 DTE,
Hey come on man. No need to get personal here.,
Little did you know, you also stepped on a lot of people's portfolios,
I don’t know how people could go in on this back when it was memed. Literal crap,
Ew, I stepped in financial ruin,
I’m averaging down to zero…,
It is if you buy puts you know?

Up isn't the only way to make bucks,
It's approaching a valuation where I might take a flyer on some shares, but any turnaround is going to take 2-4 years. Solid team, though. Probably have to rebrand at some point.,
I want to short it but i dont even think its good for that ...,
Here let me scrape this off and put it in my portfolio...,
Wish isn’t shit, wish is the shit that comes from shit,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
It's called karma for investing in a fucked up company like wish. You deserved it. Fuck you.,
I’ve gotten some pretty decent stuff from Wish before. I’ve also gotten shit so,
Poor guys,
should say Tesla,
they wish lol,
It only goes down,
Look, the community shot up GameStop stock, even if the stores buy a PS5, 10 games, and a controller for $15. We can't be too surprised by this,
WISH was always a bad investment, look at how the stock has performed over the last few years, you'd have to be incredibly stupid to think it was going up in the long term,
I once ordered a wallet for $3 off wish, took like 4 months to show up and it was worse than what you might call shit quality 😂,
The good news is that this shit reduced my cap gains for the year ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
Random but can someone teach me how to make memes like this where you edit the picture and write what you want in the picture. Thanks,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Fuck that thing....I have bad options memory with that piece of shit!!.,
Worked for tax loss harvesting for me.  Sorry Uncle Sam,
A select few niche retards are buying the dip and are here to prove the rest of wsb wrong. They're still in cause you gay bears, short sellers, and putters are still in.,
You guys bought wish, what were you expecting?,
You get what you get. WISH's entire platform is built on the fact that china gets reduced USPS prices. They can literally send stuff around our country for a discount, so why not ship one pair of socks featuring a shark eating your leg? Oh.. the USPS prices went up and now nobody wants the gimmicky shit your selling. Oops...,
Two digits soon. 

After the decimals point that is.

There was a trader, sorry - retard, who bought 80k worth of poots for monday,
Of course it will lmao yo I’m in the wrong business,
Buying weekly spy calls monday,
Thank god! I was very afraid until I read this super reliable article by cnbc,
Seeing the same Americans who scream about big pharma now suck up to it for salvation is ducking hilarious 🦆,
O my con,
They're calling it New Coke.,
so load up on ccl?,
That one guy who bought 80,000$ worth of SPY puts might need to consider a new career at Moderna.,
Gap up from ATH??? LOL,
Spy to $500 before the end of the year.,
Jesus OP how leveraged are you on calls?,
Xi is the actual one, if WHO was not a pussey.,
🤡🤡,
What are they going to do when they run out of Greek letters? Just make stuff up......,
Sounds like it’ll fit well into the media cycle,
\*only causing some heart attacks in otherwise healthy people,
I’m good thanks. I got the vaccine, don’t plan on doing this every year till I die,
Better get to be before April 2022 😂🤣🦠💉 I love this virus!,
I hope so, because then I can load up on more puts and watch them print the rest of the week.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
But they don't even have a real vaccine for existing varient yet anyway....,
TSLA $1300. Spy $470. I’ll take it.,
Fuckin joke,
Moderna is offering 4 boosters per year for $18/month.

The 4K UHD option will be extra, however.,
At this point, It's just more fear mongering. Induce hysteria, cause uncertainty, and markets will panic....giving the elites an excellent opportunity to buy at a reduced price. 

You should do the same and buy while the price is down. Moderna is an excellent choice.,
It’s all a fucking scam,
More jabs for everyone!!! How many do I need to get next year? 4? Yes, sir. As you wish, sir.,
So Moderna more-or-less says people are going to need a new shot to deal with Omicron and that is...bullish?

I mean, for MRNA yeah. But for markets? Moderna/Pfizer are basically saying their vaccines won't be effective against this new variant. They haven't said that about any previous variants.,
How many Covid Vaccines are we going to get?   

Will this count as the booster?  

 Will it be offered at no additional charge (outside of what we are paying for it in taxes)?   

Will there even be a bounce on the share price?  considering, so far, the info I've seen coming out is the symptoms are rather mild and short lived.,
It's amazing that for every move in the market people need to look for "news" to explain it.,
Damn that’s crazy I still haven’t gotten my first.. no new normal🥸,
The "vaccine" is proper diet and exercise.

Vitamin C, D, calcium, zinc, and sunlight,
Ivermectin kills heart worms, whip worms, pin worms, all worms except the tape worm. If y'all have tape worm you need a different deworming.,
**$SPY $QQQ $IWM** short squeeze back to **all time highs before end of year** LOL... **bear trap**!,
Hoping for a pullback first.,
Nah blood read mon...test 50 day then moon,
Seems fast,
I really think they wanted jst an excuse to sell,
Ispc Will sky rocket on Monday 🚀🚀🎉🎉🎰🎰,
It doesn't even sound like we will need it. The doctor that discovered it said symptoms were mild...,
3 months to make a vaccine. From now to February 😂,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
Am I the only one that thinks it’s going to be Tuesday and not Monday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
Over bought. Will be going down Monday.,
I am sure I caught the Xi variant.  Come on man!  You Know The Thing.,
Moderna selling off tomorrow,
UP DIP SZN,
Boom Lucid test ATH,
What about the delta lol,
Breed
Fear
Make
Money,
Dude. Did you hear that the variant is mild, so nobody’s gonna care. 
Puts tomorrow,
Where the fuck is the one for Delta ......,
Jpow gonna be like brrrrrr,
What was it... 100 days to edit the mrna vaccine?

Math checks out lmao,
STONKS,
Grifters gonna grift,

Pfizer setting up a Netflix subscription model .,
If everyone dies the virus won’t be able to infect new people , duh,
A more highly transmissible but less deadly virus would do wonders for boosting natural immunity around the world.,
TLDR. No one know shit.,
half days don't mean shit and omicron is not likely to be any more of a threat than any of the other post delta variants,
does this mean I can continue eating my kids gummi vitamins an not worry about it?,
Moderna pump back to 400 incoming,
Guys just 2 weeks to slow the spread cmon,
If it’s that transmissible, it’s getting everywhere.,
So March calls are Safe? :D 50-100 days…,

Omicron is an anagram for Moronic.,
It's too early to call the transmissibility claims a fact. There just isn't enough data at this point.,

What happened to the Xi variant?

If the market chops even puts won’t hold well long term.,
Discoverer of omicron says it’s symptoms are very mild.

https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/omicron-symptoms-mild-doctor-angelique-coetzee-b968715.html,
What would confirm that were re-establishing the uptrend?  Are you watching RUT or ES tonight?,
Wouldn’t a much less severe, highly transmissible variant possibly lead to a lot of natural immunity in the near future if a bunch of people very mildly get sick? Bullish for next summer,
 it has already been established that this Is a flu like virus.... there will be new variants every single year ....... are they gonna shut everything down every single year now ?? That's incredibly stupid .... the death rate at this point is incredibly negligible.... death is a part of life let's keep dealing with it as we always have .......,
If where getting another lockdown then everything will drop,
Went short on VIX eow - let’s hope everything chills out,
We should be safe since no Trump, right? I read the pandemic is was his fault. Now that the adults are back this will never spread here.,
It’s actually looking like it’s all being combined to one variant. Taking all mutations and combining them to one variant. Vaccination will almost guarantee this thing won’t be as bad as they are saying. The vaccine will still be extremely effective. But people will need boosters. I would t be too worried about it lol,
More vaccines more variants?,
I think you are underestimating the current pre-Omi situation in which some European countries have already put lockdowns or partial lockdowns in place, Australia has lockdowns in certain regions on and off throughout this period, and hospital capacity (globally) is problematic due to flu and other seasonal issues. If Omi is very transmittable and is likely already making its way throughout the world we could look at more lockdowns, more restrictions, more travel bans for a few months until this wave dies out or Omicron turns out to be non-fatal enough to allow it to roam free. It's not a March 2020 type of scenario, but I think saying the market is forward looking and hence it's just a blip after indices have doubled up since March 2020 is inaccurate. IMHO current pricing levels are based on the notion that once vaccines have been introduced, it's a done deal, and this may be an indication covid isn't a done deal.,
viruses become more transmissible and less deadly over time because, you know, evolution, that thing lovers of science say they believe in,
[deleted],
The market will be a 🚀 tomorrow.  All these variant concerns are overblown.  Have faith in JPow. 🙏,
Our leaders suck.  Unless this new variant kills 33% of those in contact, nothing changes,
The pandemic won't end untill everyone is infected. Vaccine isnt the move.,
Please go cross post this in r/politics or some far left liberal subs and watch them loose their shit, I’d LOVE to see them loose their minds,
You can buy call options on the VIX? This I did not know.,
Hmmm calculate buy the dip. Then moved to place with space.,
How can you even call a 5% broad market selloff a downtrend? Our sense of reality is so skewed here, this bubble will pop as soon as this post gives people the confidence to dump their life savings into the market.,
So you’re saying... fuck our puts again?,
Only 2% risk hedge can't really call that an overreaction,
Israel has shut its borders for 2 weeks
-Are they also gonna gather people and sing loud songs like what happened at World War Z?,
Should I go all in on calls with Charmin or Angel Soft?,
Covid season three!,
Omicron is just South Park viral marketing.,
Market did not prize in the new border closures on Friday. you might be very wrong assuming that it was all prized in.,
TLDR: Bers are fuk.,
Thank you for this:),
tl;dr yolo Pfizer calls,
Just two more weeks of lockdown!1!!!!1,
Currently trying to adjust my plague inc settings so I know what will happen,
Why are people worried about vaccinated people getting covid? Vax don’t stop cases. It’s a bigger problem if these folks get murked
Despite being double vaccinated.,
Typically viruses do trade something off with a mutation. Very common to have less deadly and more transmissible. That said the week of every designation from WHO in the short terms has seen the market only rip higher after the first 3 down days. Very likely the week starts bad, ends good and we rally the rest of dec,
Real analyst with scientific links? Are you lost?

Sir, this is a casino,
Omicron leads to worldwide immunity months. Then Powell goes full pain mode to slay inflation leading to a ten year recession. M Night Shamalan mofoers

Spy puts,
World War Xi? I mean Z,
Long apple like leaps?,
Does everything this variant, or the Evergrande collapse is going to affect the market more?,
Sell bitches, I have puts!,
Now the issue is that futures are green 🥴,
Yep, MRNA dropped to $200 below what it was a couple months ago and suddenly a new variant discovered and Fauci telling everyone to get vaccinated and get boosters… buy MRNA, and/or buy MRNA calls…,
2 more weeks and we will be there!
Btw china red right now, just opening….,
Less deadly, but because it will affect more people, the number of deaths can still be high,
This is like fast and furious 12 now. It’s over, no once cares anymore. Great write up!,
Another overblown media mess that’s fucking up our market,
Futures basically confirming variant isn’t going to be an issue and Friday was an over reaction,
Forget Walmart or McDonalds, every neighbourhood should have a Moderna; get your new variant vax fresh from the source!,
I just saw alpha furin CLEVAGE 🍈🍈,
Truth about China bad. Truth about Vachina good,

One mildly red day and people already pointing fingers at retail. Smdh,
Gme and amc lol... all retail is dumb and only trust wall street... just give it a rest,

How is the stability of the system somehow hinging on the smallest end users?????,
#smdh,
Friday wasn't retail. All travel companies were down premarket at the same %. Most of retail doesn't even trade pre,
You mean the Black Friday stonks sale + put writing opportunity? What was I supposed to learn from that?,
shut the fuck up wsj. you already reported that most retail investors got out of stocks and are "piling" into crypto. why don't we talk about portfolio margin ratios?,
Every. Single. Hedge. Fund. Is. Leveraged. 5x. Minimum.

But the articles will be about retail because Average Joe’s $50k loan that caused him to get margin called on a large cap is clearly what caused the next market crash,

There's some really great mental gymnastics in this article. Apparently imposing import tariffs on Chinese products will make those products more expensive, but the article says that this is due to "retaliation" by China rather than, duh, the tariffs.,
Sounds like it is the right thing to do if China is against it,
Fuck the CCP.,
America tries to better itself in tech in innovation. 

China says that it will gravely damage America’s own interest. 

Lol o ok. Chinas level of gaslighting on an international level is rather troll worthy,
All bark

Well done man. I swear the biggest wins on here are the ones people talked the most shit about.,
Unlike some of the other commenters on here who I’d like to ask “Show me on the doll where big bad Lucid hurt you” … I’d like to say congratulations on your gains and make sure you have an exit strategy in place, plans for taxes, and a nice beach with cocaine and hookers to move to. 👍,
I knew lcid was a winner because WSB hated it while promoting pump and dumps like wish. My price was $49 for the stock so I got out but I’m making about $500/day selling puts on it. When the next catalyst comes out for it, whether good or bad, I’ll change my strategy.,
Comments are so salty.  
Awesome gains OP!,
Wish I had bought more than 300 shares at $14,
Lucid seems to not drop below 50 now seems to be the support from now on,
Fuck you, I didn't even look!,
Nice hold so far Ape,
No questioning the smart, just emphasizing the lucky.

What other arrows are in your quiver?,
[deleted],
Did any of you jokers buy puts? Lol get fuked idiots.. post lost porn,
Lucid is dogshit they won't meet their production numbers and good luck competing with literally ever other car company making EVs. Anyone buying at these levels will baghold for years.

Lucid market cap is literally higher than ford. It's absolutely idiotic to think this company will ever be able to compete with Ford. 

Ford is selling 4.2 million cars per year. Lucid is promising 20k by 2022. Nice. Not to mention Fords product line of EVs is going to be much better with an established name and brand.

Enjoy it while it lasts don't be holding Lucid when the EV bubble pops though.

Symptoms of a completly irrational market.,
Lol. Sell half dude,
Must be nice,
Can I have a dolla kind sir. Betta 4 dolla for wendys,
Not really.  Show use once you close it out,
How often have you been doing CCs?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
That is some tasty works right there,
Close it and buy NIO instead; how much higher can LCID go ?,
I hope you own a reservable jacket,
Pmcc?,
Congratulations, fuck you, and what color Lucid are you buying?,
Good job

However $LCID won't last long at this price. Great company, doesn't have enough catalysts for now until they can expand production or announce partnerships. I recommend taking profits.

&#x200B;

Good luck regardless!,
I'm pretty sure that at this point if you combined production estimates for each individual EV + existing auto producer they'd come in higher than total auto market production forecasts, so yes, pick any auto stock and it should quadruple.,
Im up over $60,000 today,
So you fucc Flacid?,
RIP tomorrow 09.30 am,

There’s a reason the floor for a gains post on WSB with shares is much higher … this is Wall Street **BETS** buy some ITM calls next time,
This stock is mooning cuz its a covid variant. Nice work,
What do green numbers mean?,
Does that say 24%? Bro you could make that just buying shares and shit.

Edit: oh, that’s exactly what you did. Gtfo boomer.,
Keep holding,
Nice,

Went all in on NIO calls Friday. They're the only Chinese company I fuck with,
What the fuk. To the moon,
Nio   


Dec 1st : November sales number.

Dec 18th : NIO day.

Jan 18th \* : Q4 results,
NIO has to be the best EV place for new money, they are the chosen one in China, they have a better mouse trap in battery swap!

Oh and YTD down 33% despite better growth than the rest, and expanding to multiple continents… also mark my words AFRICA… 

Les go, this ain’t financial advice but I love me some Nio 2024 leaps and the stonk!,
NIO is either my early retirement or keep on working for the next 30 years.,
Great news , lets moon that stock ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote),
I’ve been trading NIO for the past year. It is a money maker. I am pretty sure that when they present second quarter 2022, it will start flying.,
Nio gonna moon in December 🚀🚀🚀,
Bought 2 years ago around $3.50. I won't even think about selling until this baby goes to $300.

Grandpapa wants his boat! ⛵,
Won't matter. NIO is a chinese stock. If NIO was a US stock it would have 4x the market cap,
This is just the ground floor for Nio, hold for 10 years become a millionaire.,
Ok I'm from Poland and it's not good information for NIO holders.

First of all our government will fuck this deal 💯%, not even slightest doubts about it. No media talk RN about it and they are searching for any investor news they can promote. 
Nothing about NIO. 

2.	Amazon started two years ago to build here logistic centers and they have workers problem all the time because nobody want to work in shitjobs anymore when You just can pack your bags and go to Germany in like 5h car ride from anywhere in Poland. Even Ukrainians here fuck shitjobs.

3.	Good luck opening here even fucking kiosk. Polish law is one of the most idiotic and not profitable here in whole UE. 

4.	Poland is constantly in political fight with European Union so making something here while polexit can happen anytime is stupid.,
How many people does it take to build a EV factory in Poland?,
With PiS behind the gov wheel? I’ll consider puts lol,
Let’s do it I’m in BABY,
Did someone say moon? Because I'm ready to fly.,
I have big (for me anyways) positions on NIO, but it looks like the Poland news was a technical error according to the company.

So I guess they want to announce at NIO day instead? Maybe?,

The Saudi Arabia Stock Exchange - the great bellwether for global markets.,
All because Newcastle lost.,
What does that even mean? What is the size of the Arabian stock exchange?,
They were closed on Friday. The market just anticipated the movement from the other Markets that were open on Friday.,
Friendly reminders:
1. Market was closed on friday
2. Saudi stocks are mostly in OIL; which dropped 13%.
3. No tech or biotech or pharma stocks to amortize 

Doesnt look a big drop given the circumstances

All the money from these sales will go in US market tomorrow,
Red = haram,
Tel Aviv Stock exchange index is down only 1.5% while it was closed on Friday. The Saudis have mostly oil stocks.,

OPEC will give big middle finger to Biden on DEC 2nd. Mark my words,
Meh... not many lockdowns yet... a bit of an overreaction really... especially as far as the US is concerned... anybody really think Biden will support another round of closures? Thousands still dying every day... no one cares anymore... many never did...,
Saudi Arabia is very oil dependent so that drop makes sense based on a 10% drop in oil prices,
Saudis have an exchange? I thought the royal family owned everything and the rest of the population was slaves,
Fucking who cares about the Arab stock exchange Maybe they will have to cut a few terrorist groups from their payrolls,
Tel Aviv Stock exchange index is down only 1.5% while it was closed on Friday. The Saudis have mostly oil stocks.,
Monday be like...,
Like this market mattered anyways,
They're following the US equity market. Largely irrelevant. I'm willing to bet that AAPL's market capitalization on wearables (Airpods,iwatch) alone is bigger than the entire market cap of the stock exchange in Riyadh.,
Guacamole, salsa, onion, queso… there are so many good dips to buy,
No one cares about this shit hole stock honestly.,
It should decline on “Biden is on to your price gouging” news.,
Short Saudi Arabia? 😂,
Saudi Aramco is their biggest stock, and oil fell $10 a barrel, so makes sense.,
This variant is no joke. spy puts, yang calls, mrna calls,
[removed],
Think we will see what we are in for this evening as Nikki and Hang Seng open.,
Amazon and Shopify caaaaaalllllllsssss, bitch!,
Panic selling noobs,
Sand futures were up,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
TIL there are other stock exchanges outside of USA,
ALLAHU ACKBAR!,
Buy cro and all dips,
Tiger king could be the next pump.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/tiger-king-coin-and-6-other-weird-cryptos-to-watch-in-2022%3famp,
and this is why American exchanges are smart enough to stay closed on the week ends.,
This is the dip we’ve been dreaming of boys and girls, wait for it to plummet a bit further and scooooooooppppppp!,
DEATH TO AMERICA,

Stop being a pussy you’ll be in a lambo by Tuesday,
That theta.,
boi if you dont sell asap,
My $300 puts say bring it on!,
If you have to ask...,
Just wait until I post I gain or loss porn:)),
Should have a huge pop Monday since apparently they can create the omnicron vaccine in 100 days,
Ok Van. Let’s see.,
Look at that Theta!!!,
This must be the worst interface. I can’t understand a thing.,
Can’t hold it till Tuesday. I’m gonna sell tomorrow if not gap up,
Full,
How high did you think an already overvalued stock could go?,
That’s some heavy size there. I don’t think I’d sell immediately if I held 189 cons over the weekend. You’re down 9-10%? Not too bad, but $400 is overly ambitious. That’s way otm, and heavy size, and held over the weekend. 😅 Stress free weekend?,
What's your plan?

Close the position at market open? 

Some combination of selling some and holding the rest?

Wait until Friday and watch MRNA have a massive run of \~19% only to fall short and expire worthless OTM at $399?,
You’re a genius, retard,
Honestly it could go +40% in 3 weeks easy so nice,
One VN guy posts gain porn, then another posts loss porn, both on the same stock. Perfectly balanced.,
Maybe I’m wrong but I think $360 SP should be your First Line of defense.,
Yes,
bet all in you big pussy,
[removed],
How retard are you? I’d say about 3 of them,
Have the exact same ones. Good luck!,
You're kinda being in omicron killing a bunch of people,
They're going to pump to $400 this week,
Why chase?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
Obligatory congrats and fuck you. I got caught up with work and forgot to buy my tickets,

Hey /u/SpongebobSoundByte, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Great analysis, but social credit score -9999, see you in concentration camps.,
There’s a reason it hasn’t shot up. It takes years to turn out new capacity and investors basically already know their revenue. It’s not a tech company, it’s manufacturing so it won’t move as much as others. Still a good play, but don’t expect a 10 bagger here,
Do the same now for ASML 🚀,
I yolo on this due to the same analysis, u forgot to mention the new vr from Apple will be only patent with tsm cpu, they have shit ton of demand and fab are working 100%.
Is just unluck stock born in the wrong country if this was from usa it was trading easy at 400$.

We need a bull wave pass 145, and ceo annuncing a split.

Its the only way.

Técnically 107-111 loading up.

128 if not brake is a sell point.,
TSM Is my 2nd biggest winner stock. Under 120 is a great buy in, under 115 is a no brainer. Hoping we see 140 by mid Jan.,
I loaded up on a handful of 12/31 118c when they dipped down during the middle of Nov.,
Thanks, i'll wait $110 again for entry,
not bagholding but am disappointed with the price action when compared to NVDA or AMD or even ASML. what gives? is it because it is close proximity with China??,
I like TSMC, but Intel in my eyes is more undervalued and are aggressively trying to get back to premier status,
No thanks Jeff, I’ll load up on SOXL,
No it's not, shilling on my boi Himx here.,
As a bagholder all year long, I am appreciating all the recent pep talks.

  
I just hope we can get a santa rally and close this year above 125.,
Nobody cares if china invades. WW3 will not be fought to save AMD and Nvda fanboys. INTEL is the play if you're looking for a undervalued semi. 9 p/e with fastest chips on the market , new gpu coming out , new fabs , congress about to give them billions,  MobileEye about to be the clear leader in robotaxi etc. List goes on and on. It's only in the shitter based purely on sediment and that will change as it always does then it'll rise like Phoenix from the ashes.,
Great DD, but of all of them Intel is probably the one you can invest in now.  China will take over Taiwan and the US will not do anything about it.  Not even Trump will try to stop it.  Intel is behind on Tech but not behind on cash.  They are the only ones that could quickly diversify supply chains.  But with that said, I am not investing in them.  I prefer my FDs,
Is intel dead and not worth of investing at all??,
>ON Semiconductor Corp. (ON) could produce exceptional returns because of its solid growth attributes.

Instructions unclear bought 0dte spy fds,
Your solution to avoid decay is to buy LEAPS…. You do realize they already have ridiculously low Theta right? This is just a PMCC with an extra LEAPS,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
I thought this was called a superbull,
Ahh, the good old Zebra.  70/50 delta is probably close enough for this to work, but isn't necessarily the best way to make a true zebra (zero extrinsic back ratio).  The best way is to add a column that shows the extrinsic value in the contracts and make sure that the two your buying add up to the same ev you're selling.  Works on both sides (calls and puts). 

If you're doing this on the call side, you can add and atm put to make money if the stock goes either way, just gotta make sure it goes away from your atm straddle or you'll lose money.,
Options market makers love this kind of thinking. The more volume the better!,
This was actually interesting.,
I got my dick caught in the ceiling fan AGAIN!,
What about when the underlying stock sells off to your 70d C strike? What happens to your theta then?,
Buy and sell the same day nimrod,
Or grow some nuts and use short puts to pay for your long calls.,
You're describing a bull call spread where you are buying the option at the lower strike and selling an option at a higher strike for the same security. It means you are bullish but want to reduce risk and cash outflow. This DOES NOT negate theta. As long as you are longing an option, you will pay theta, it is inevitable.,
I have no idea about strategies. Got a Msft call for a year out a while ago. Price is down from when I bought it but I’m only down 5 bucks. Idk how all the math works but I feel like going a while out is way safer. Some days the price would be down but I would be up money. Crazy,
🦓🚀,
His is way to educational foe this sub.  New?,
Like the wsb has the best investment rep lol chill out bro,
[removed],
This is an over explanation of lottery tickets,
Or you could put on a Synthetic stock position.... synthetic long stock= Long ATM call short ATM put (matching strikes)  you get roughly 100 deltas, offsetting theta, and more leverage.  

Dont make shit more complicated than it needs to be.,
why does this movie exist?,
F&F films nowadays = Bollywood films that take themselves seriously.,
Messa with the NATO

All you can afford is the potato,
The virgin economic theory Vs the Chad Erdogan,
Rte is the biggest retard,

Complains about 'level playing field'. There is no level playing field.,
Company engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the west accuses Indian company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior in India. More at 11.,
Can I just say that RuPay is an excellent name for an Indian payment processor?,
Visa sounds like a spoiled child that's going to get his DAD to beat up your DAD,
>Mastercard and Visa count India as a key growth market, but have been jolted by a 2018 central bank directive for them to store payments data "only in India" for "unfettered supervisory access".

>Mastercard faces an indefinite ban on issuing new cards in India after the central bank said it was not complying with the 2018 rules. A USTR official privately called the Mastercard ban "draconian", Reuters reported in September.

So it's draconian for a country to insist that the data of its citizens be only stored onshore.,
how can i buy shares of rupay?,
Actually Rupay has only a small market share and people doesn’t prefer it in India .
The real competition for Visa is UPI in which Google Pay is the market leader . The transaction volumes are rising everyday and is huge . The transfers using UPI is instant and is going to be the future .,
I would highly suggest people in this sub research the Flexa Network. Visa and Mastercard won’t be the only options for processing payments. Adapt or be left.,
Ah of course our destiny in the East is to silently let the white man make profits all the time at our expense. Cunts.,
what does visa want the goverment to do ...send the fucken army and invade delhi.,
I hope RuPay eats'em up! F* Visa and MC. Spoiled little whiny bitches... there isn't a level playing field in business you pukes! That's the point of business. Let the good succeed and the hell with the bad. This fucking too big to fail and bailout era we have been living in is pathetic. If you run your business like shit, then eat shit. I'm so sick of this scared era. Like damn, let UPS take over the most inefficient run organization of USPS. Let tesla eat up the stragglers, let SpaceX eat up Nasa, and let gamestop eat whatever it wants. Let those that do right keep doing right. Ugh.. ok rant over lol,
All PM Modi has to do is to ask President Biden at what stage of approval is the Indian Covid Vaccine COVAXIN is with FDA.,
Didn’t read article…

Can someone confirm if RuPaul is founder?,
Cards are so last century. We just just move to mobile payment like China,
I wonder when visa wl succeed in its complain to Bejing Biden about fair play in china.,
Jeez. India always complaining. 

"Get out of here colonizers" now Visa. Ugh,
From Drag Race to payment systems? Impressive.,
Better than RakeshPay,
I hope those Visa and Mastercard leeches taxing every transaction die of a Greek letter. 2% is too much for the service we are getting.,
Looks like they need some democracy.,

Interesting. Just a little googling around this is what I have found.

I think I’ll look into it to see if interest rate hikes would pump it up a bit.

https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/prudential-completes-jackson-financial-demerger-intends-to-sell-down-initial-stake-271631522957

So prudential owns 20% and has publicly announced they will sell off at least half within 12 months. Additionally some share holders received shares of Jackson at a 40:1 ratio.

It also appears Jackson is not an insurance company. They market themselves a annuities and retirement services. Not sure if it’s comparable to all of your selected companies. Might want to remove AIG and any of the others which primarily sell insurance.

“WHY INVESTORS SHOULD SELL THEIR SHARES IN JACKSON LIFE

Low interest rates coupled with high market volatility have combined to create extremely difficult conditions for Jackson Life’s core variable rate annuity business. This has resulted in higher reserve requirements and hedging costs which have consumed a huge portion of the cash flows generated by the business.

Moreover the American business is distinctly mature and the market is sceptical about the sector’s ability to generate consistently high returns. This is reflected in the market ratings ascribed to Jackson’s peer group. Brighthouse trades at 0.13 times its net asset value and just 2.5 times forward earnings and Lincoln National trades at an almost as unloved rating of 0.3 times NAV and 3.4 times forward earnings.”

https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/article/what-investors-should-do-after-prudentials-jackson-life-split,
Just a word of caution guys.  Be careful when definitely setting a "book value" on companies when both their assets and liabilities are something like a multiple of 100 over their market cap.  It's a good opportunity for mistakes to either severely overvalue or severely undervalue a company.  Especially when it's a financial or insurance company, there have been plenty of times where it turned out policies written years ago didn't take into account certain risks or couldn't as technology was just different at the time, and a whole business segment went underwater.

You'll sometimes see the same thing with REITs.  I know I made some mistakes years ago with some REITs that on the surface looked like they were trading at 25% of book value or something silly.  Turns out, that wasn't silly, and their junk properties were some of the first to go under water when COVID hit.  And before that some of their biggest tenants went under in the preceding years.

Good luck, hope it pans out for you.  I'll probably buy a few shares without researching anything myself as a "see what happens in a couple years", cause the forced selling thing sounds like a reasonable reason for a price to be artificially low for a while.  Also I've been a mini fan of Prudential Financial for a while, and if they are a part owner, I'm interested.,
oh fucking finally the bot didn't auto-delete it, it thinks it's the c-word but I'm actually talking about boomer stock,

I have had Eli Lilly for years -they are a good performer. My favorite however (not related to Alzheimers has been Thermo Fisher Scientific). They really BLEW UP last couple of years. 

&#x200B;

Roche is a no for me just because they are involved in so many things and they are huge,
You should look deeper into the circumstances behind Biogen’s approval. It was absolute insanity. That drug never should have made it to market. You look at shit like Vioxx and say “how did everyone miss the warning signs?” But this time around it’s “look at those warning signs, better move them aside so we don’t scratch the Lambo.”  

I’m shocked nobody has turned up evidence of bribes or blackmail or something. Seems like it was just good old fashioned incompetence.,

Omicron sounds like a decepticon name from the original Transformers so im not worried,
Look 

After surviving March 2020

I ain’t scared of Chet ok 

Plus I’m 7x leveraged in tqqq anyway so I’m fine in tech,
I feel like the market is looking for an excuse to cool off. They’ll take any bad news and blame it. So I see down on Monday, confusing volatility for a week or two that ends flat like some psycho trading range, then to new ATH once omicron is more accurately profiled. 

Basically I would not buy puts. I would sell them and buy calls and shares during any whiplash.,
Bull for streaming, gaming, dating, e-commerce, and social media stocks! 👍,
It’s a scariant,
My opinion is it will keep dipping for some time, but once the market realize its just another variant it’ll go up again.

So yes definitely going to buy the dip!,
where is the guy who shorted the WHOLE South Africa?,
Knee jerk reaction by market will be to crash because traditional straight forward thought process is bad news = bad economy.

So the saying of buying the fear would be the less popular opinion which would be the right thing to do.
Plus this is nothing new to what has been happening so I don’t see this new thing affecting companies more than it already has. 

Good all-weather industries will continue to thrive and fair weather ones will evolve or die and be relaxed - similar to normal non-pandemic periods.,
It’s bullish as fuck (imagine how easily this will become an excuse to keep rates down even longer👍),
(o)Micron Technology bull (MU),
“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”,
the market was caught by surprise on a low volume, short session day and it overreacted. Thisnweek and the next we will have some volatility as new cases in europe and the US are made public and restrictions to travel are put in place. After that we will keep going higher because they are not fucking up the economy in christmas and we see this is just another variant that is mild on the vaccinated,
Hoping Viacom goes up finally lmao,
It's going to be a damp squib like every variant before it, so I'm bullish. And look what happened last time with COVID, even when it was bad... Market went up. 

So bullish.,
The question isn’t bullish or bearish… It’s wtf are you buying?,
Something abnormal going on. I believe this dip is unrelated to omicron. If it was them gold should have responded positive,
Anyone else think the market is just looking for a reason to dump? We are just about due for a 10% correction...,
Bullish for tech, especially software.,
Viruses tend to get weaker overtime with mutations and variants. South Africa has already said this is very mild markets are overreacting,
Money printer go brrrr longer now maybe as a positive vs lockdowns forever and we all die in time.

Time to go all in 🚀,
When does the market NOT seriously over-react anymore?

Traders today are like Australian quokkas. Looks so cute but if they panic they’ll throw out everything they have including their own children and flee.,
I will be bull in pharmaceutical stock and social psychopath network,
In 10 years time, no one will know what Omicron is.,
Bear.

Here's why this variant is different. (mostly a copied comment from another thing. I'm a former prof who used to research this stuff a lot).

**No previous variant has elicited a "we'll update the vaccine for it" response from vaccine makers.** Moderna and Pfizer didn't have to issue statements bc researchers knew right away that existing vaccines would suffice. Now both have made statements suggesting new boosters will be necessary. Pfizer we can get it made in 100 days. Moderna is looking to double dosage boosters and rapid development of Omicron specific booster. Please backcheck me on this but doing a lot of searching, I could only find statements from Pfizer and Moderna about Lambda and other variants that existing dosage and vaccine doses were sufficient to combat the new variants.

**Epidemiological differences**. Contains a wide variety of mutations including 30 to the spike protein. It is widely believed this variant is the product of a mutagenic properties of patients with untreated HIV/AIDS infections. There's been evidence in the past and warnings by concerned scientists and doctors about making vaccines more available in less wealthy parts of the world where untreated HIV is more common.

**Market reaction**. But its hard not to put the piece of data out there that the market simply didn't react this negatively to any other variant, not even Delta. Neither the discovery of variants nor declaration of them being VOC's produced a significant market reaction. Delta was declared a VOC on May 6th 2021 for example. SPY was green that day. Tough to gauge by PFE and MRNA prices because PFE had a divvy and MRNA had earnings that day but their prices didn't jump nearly as much as they did Friday.

**Accelerated WHO VOC designation**. Mentioned this before but I think it bears repeating. Delta was discovered in Oct. 2020 and was designated a VOC May 6th 2021. **(7 months).** Omicron was discovered Nov. 9th and declared a VOC Nov. 26 **(17 days).** Maybe the WHO is full of shit and/or over-reacting but their actions would indicate that there something exceptional about this variant.

\*\*\*

I don't think we're looking at a reset of the whole pandemic. But its probable imo that it will functionally take us back to Feb. of 2021 where there was a rush to get the (then recently approved) vaccine into everyone. If Omicron needs a new booster, it'll be another race against time. And potentially a fucking nightmare for places with low vaccination rates (parts of sub-saharan africa, alabama, Yemen).

There is a chance (which would be terrific) that Omicron's symptoms are not nearly as bad as Delta and it is still able to out-compete Delta for hosts. Its the nature of viruses to become less destructive to their hosts over time, though 2 years into a zoonotic jump seems early for that. All the same, there's an outside shot Omicron is a good thing 🤷‍♂️,
I bought the morning dip (ALK) Alaska air and sold 2 hours later made 4%.   If you buy airlines, domestic ones will turn positive sooner, because they don’t rely on business.,
Markets soared post-Covid. I made more in 2020 than I ever have in my life. I can only for a repeat.,
BEAR  
61 passengers out of 600 arriving in Amsterdam tested positive:

13 of them verified omicron variant,
Democrats can’t give up more ground or political face.

Money printer must stay on for the holidays.

Buying calls and maintaining long positions.,
Data is not conclusive on Omicron, time has to pass until we see wether hospitals start to fill or not. I’ve researched this and a scientists don’t know yet. Insaw articals misphrasing scientists and getting to conclusions. Too early.,
Info came out from a South Africa health official saying it's very mild,
Bullish personally after reading your apes comments

If we end up wrong I guess I'll be begging my wife's boyfriend on my knees to let me sleep on the front door's floor, like a good doggy,
A good time to buy yes. A poor time to sell,
It's not going to be like Feb-Mar 2020, but it's still good to be positioned for more downturn in the short run. Way to play this is shorting options. I don't see this past Friday as a dip worth buying.

-The variant being mild isn't the point. Government response could still be to shut down a few things.

-Workers will continue to not want to go in. The affects some industry   sentiment.

-VIX was already creeping up for a few months

-Market was already too high imo

>What are your thoughts fellow apes?

Shut the fuck up and buy GME if this is how you talk,
Its always the same. Retards will never know what to do in any given situation at any time... 😂,
Yeah think you’ve got it nailed on. I’m buying the red at open. If it drills deeper red then meh, people are dumb.,
Calls on Delta puts on Omicron,
I think the market will be volatile and might still decline a bit as varies policies are being announced. Once the water is clear we are off to ATH. So strategically, I think it’s better to wait a while for dust to settle,
Keep a stack of cash and wait for crash,
omicron is just news trying to paying the bills,
Bear. Spreads 5x faster than Delta, no word on lethality. Supposedly uses different spike proteins reducing vaccine effectiveness.,
Bear all the way unless we hear it’s less deadly. Then it’s bull all the way. That’s the bottom line.,
How many times we have to stress that it is never about the severity. You could have a flu-like disease which has a mortality rate comparable to being hit by a freakin aircraft in your garden, the market will still crash if there are stupid politicians who impose even stupider lockdowns and restrictions.

It is the media and especially social media which keeps making waves about COVID, noone would care anymore.,
Buying the dip in terms with shares is fine, buying the dip in 0dte calls before a new support and clear uptrend has been establish is a disaster 😂😂,
Uncertainty is the worse situation that the market can be but it’s not the case here, if you can make new vaccine version for any variant in Total 100 days it will be temporary pullback only,
Friday was an overreaction. Gap up tomorrow morning.,
I threw more money into my ETFs and a few stocks to DCA down a bit on Friday. I’ll take a look into options tomorrow,,
The Middle East is down ~5% right now. Make it stop please. Otherwise from panic sellers and margin call liquidations, this won’t stop anytime soon. The correction will continue.,
this comment section is confusing and infuriates us!,
A nothing burger, load up on Monday.,
That’s some good analysis. However, have you considered 🌈🐻,
Gap up Monday.

Mr Market has already dealt with the latest scariant,
Cloud computing calls. Covid or no covid. Cloud computing calls. Front end and back end. SKYY and CLOU. This is the way,
Bull or bear only matters in the short term. Stop thinking short term. Zoom out! Get off the 10 minute chart and load up the 1 day chart. Market goes up,
Im no ape. It’s retarded cuck thank you. SPY put FD’s,
Omicron (sure let’s skip some letters) looks to be more subdued than Delta. Causes a mild, flu-like syndrome without the classic hallmarks of novel rona. Hopefully that stays true.,
Small cap growth stocks needed the 10 year bond and oil prices to drop significantly.  On Friday they dropped 10%.,
Mm's creating panic so they can load up before bull run,
Fuck omricon.. let’s go SPY to $500🚀🚀,
sorry, stopped reading after this: Let's not be apes for a minute and think.,
Stocks performed well during the real pandemic. Another variant doesn’t change anything. There’ll always be another variant.
BULL,
Kang gang friend.,
“Let’s not be apes for a minute…” Dude- know your audience! This is Reddit!!,
Cannabis... bullish... covid proof, and there's more good news than ever before.,
As the pandemic becomes an endemic, the future is uncertain. Either way, as a society, we will move on, as with HIV or polio. Life goes on.,
This market is a fantasy,
lmao all the people in this thread that didn't realize we were pumping 2% today.,
Buy some cheap SPY puts to hedge a bit, then buy the dip if/when it starts dropping. I think any dip will be short term, seeing as it’s not unlikely that Omicron is a non-issue, and worst case is that we have new vaccines in 3 months.,
Only 4 people had omicron and experienced mild symptoms.,
I got Omicron yesterday, feels uplifting, energetic and quite positive. Highly recommend to travel to South Africa.


Also, buy the dip.,
There was a lot of fear and from chart perspective the markets had to correct.
Due to first insights the variant shows mild symptoms so…,
Bear. Government's about to bend you and your stepsister over the washing machine, doesn't matter how dangerous it is on Omicron Persei 8. Break out your study guides from 2020. Tesla and ARK to the moon!,
The next two weeks are uncertain until we know how effective the vaccines are.,
I’m not an ape.,
Who didn’t see other variants coming? Variants were always inevitable. I think this is a knee jerk sell off, and we will be back in a few weeks, after the debt ceiling is kicked down the road again.,
Ape,
The fact that it isn’t really affected by vaccines suggests that when it mutates further, things could get dicey.

Even if the symptoms are mild, the fact that vaccines are useless should be fairly worrying. People act like it isn’t going to mutate further in ~2 months.,
Panicking over a flu like virus having a new variant is stupid .... there will be new one every single year .... the death rate is extremely negligible ..... time to move on people will  die its a part of life .....,
I don’t think we have enough information yet to know if it’s going to be super bad. That being said, it could potentially be worse than anything we’ve seen so far.,
I think until Pfizer publish a press release in the next 10-20 days about how serious and lethal and how fast they can create new vaccines the omicron variant we are in a bear territory,
Pro tips: when everyone says market would drop on Monday, that mean it could go 3%+ green,
The vaccine seems to be largely ineffective against this variant. It will take a few months to make a new booster for this variant, by which time it will already be everywhere. We don’t yet know enough about this variant to accurately estimate the risk. Nothing is scarier than an unknown, so I think it keeps dipping for a week or longer, depending on the details as they trickle out.,
It's not the Omicron, it's general health of the financial system.  IMO, which is wanted less than bedbugs at a hotel convention, the market will dip lower until February.,
It really has zero to do with Omicron. It is all about the climate of fear the Biden, Fauci, and the blue states will try and instill in people.,
This was a complete shit show....In Europe the cases was already rising now the authorities and media found something to blame. Lot of people are still unvaccinated especially in Northern Europe,close to 40% in some countries which is a lot.

Remember Mu variant found in Colombia and Peru like Omicron even Mu was hyped a lot.

Only positive is slump in brent crude and an opportunity to buy certain value stocks at low prices for long term.,
It’s all a game.,
Bearish on micron,
and to all the people who thinks market overreacted, market traded on low volumes. Listen retards the hole world was down heavily. It maynot be due to this virus but market positioning to kill all DECEMBER SANTA RALLY BULLS.,
Bullen,
I think people are forgetting about the lambda variant as well. No one freaked out over that. The market didn’t tank over the lambda variant. What I do worry about is this temporary downturn being coupled with something more serious like a drastic interest rate hike.,
Covid? What’s that?,
With Omicron soon to take over anyone else looking into Bio? Look into SRNE shorted 60 million due to arbitration case with LA times owner this Tuesday (Google Sorrento therapeutics Vs LA times owner) https://nakedshortreport.com/company/SRNE. The company has bunch of EUA’s approved EU,Brazil, Mexico. Stock is manipulated from $17 to $6 recently check out for yourself. I am all in. Good luck!,
I’m in MRK and PFE heavy with puts for PFE and calls on MRK but now I’m thinking I should load up on calls for PFE as well...anyone in these and what y’all think?,
Morning sell off from people asleep on Friday. Then quick green due to everyone who found out their stop losses triggered and they're sitting on piles of cash with discounts galore.,
IMHO markets should have done the worst of the overreaction already Friday. Now it all depends on the first data they analyze.

SA head of doctors pointed that although it has much higher transmissability, it has milder symptoms it seems. Furthermore, the pool of people with it that could be a good enough data set are not possible to be used for correlation with europe becuase of such a low vaccination rate.

Breakthrough infections were happening already as we are now right at the moment when most people with both jabs are at the reduced infection protection.

With how many 1st jabbers popping up in Europe and considering the large amount of third doses that the variant undoubtedly will spur, I am confident European markets will contain loss. US not so sure,
Market is only down 2.5%. You can get that on a day with no news. Until it drops 10%/15%, you can't really call it a sell off,
Options market is pricing in massive move this week in spy.  This id dipping hard and soon....ill be buying,
I think Monday will be volatile. The rest will depend on how much gaslighting the MSM does. That will also depend on whether rioting picks up or tapers off.,
Hoping for a 🐂. 

💯expecting a massive 🐻,
Look at Germany🇩🇪, they are extremely pressured by COVID right now. And to put some icing on that cake we now have the new variant. GLHF euro, bye bye.,
Bug,
bull. get some INO stock.,
Omicron is transient!,
Algo's and Wall St will gin up the scare. In two to three weeks they wiil have snapped up all the paper handed shares and up we go again.,
Bull but question is when to buy back lol my guess is towards end of dec,
yes, this omnicron b.s.variant-bullshit-samething-as-the-flu will give us a fanatastic dip to buy, powell will print money to pay us and the path to lambos is easy to see, lets get rich

TLTR: fake variant + powell (fake money) = dip + buy = real lambo,
we will know tonight based on what type of news the media is dropping. if they are still pushing omnicron i am bearish af.,
Well, Biden has been a fuckup in responding to things. I’m going out on a limb here and guess he will over respond to omicron as well. Bear.,
Oh it's totally bull........................ shit.,
First one, then the other,
Bullish or Bearish, doesn’t mean shit to me. Either way when the time comes and it will soon, AMC is gonna make me a lot of money.,
Big pharma vax companies will do testing next 2 weeks to see effectiveness vs Omicron. Next 2 weeks mean absolutely nothing until those results are released.,
Where are you buying puts?,
Omicron deez nutz,
I’m bullish. I’m not sure this will have the same effect but it’s hard to tell.,
Just more fear mongering for now I guess. Maybe a slight dip but nothing like Friday.,
I was 95% cash on Wednesday night currently around 80% and holding. But I've been 80% for almost a year.,
Literally sold all my stock on Friday,
It matters naught how strong black Friday was, it matters  naught delta or omicron ( nomad soul) lol... Bidens Build Back Better plan will put people back to work and strengthen the Economy,  in concert with a Fed rate hike in the first quarter of 2022 of 1% ( I would suggest 2%) we will see an economic recovery as we have never seen before.  In such an economy,  Stocks will rises high, the taper will hasten and all will be normal again.,
Fake,
Bull.
Calls for airlines.,
Bullish. Time to buy. 

I’ve got cash on hand to do so because I missed the last little 5%-6% correction in September so I’m buying this one. 

Don’t miss out.,
I guys still think anyone except hysterical msm care about covid?!,
Bull - this will blow over,
I have already seen an article that states that "omicron symptoms are mild, but could be more dangerous to unvaccinated."

In other words it's yet another scare to influence unvaccinated to get a jab. It's also a reason to have a harder crackdown on the EU's anti mandate civil disobedience and further lockdowns.,
Was in the mall with my mouth breathing ex-wife yesterday. She was all masked up b/c of of the Decepticon strain.

She’s following orders from her teacher’s Union.

The fear is strong with this one.,
mRNA vaccines can be developed in 6 weeks, this is an overreaction people are primed for fear and uncertainty over the past 2 years, it’s a bear trap imo but I don’t have crystal ball or be a scientist I’m just an idiot on Reddit,
Hate to say it but the Democrats will blow this up to extend it into the midterm elections...They want the mail in ballots..im in Michigan and they sent me six..,

Autist, you’re fine. Cyber Monday is about to be huge because there was a lot less foot traffic for all the Black Friday retailers. Shopify posted record e-commerce sales for Black Friday, so Amazon sales are guaranteed to be big. With the Moderna and Pfizer news, we’re likely to have a rally on Monday as well, with big tech being “defensive” plays,
Amazing losses bro! 
Crazy, you doing very good .. but in the false direction.,
Bruh imma be honest, this is retarded but I respect it.,
Call, put, what strike? Either way good job retard,
Wendy’s near me is hiring,
This is a first. Someone bought calls and lost money. This sub is downhill from here.,
Best of luck dude. I’ve lost almost 2k in all ever since and I feel like shit.,
First thing Monday, no masterbating, instead click the sell to close button.,
at least you didnt lose everything. there’s always tomorrow bro, just try harder ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
That strike is well into "you're screwed" territory.,
Some good loss porn,

Thetagang nuts big time for a few days and then we all suffer IV crush in a day or so when VIX drops again.,
VIX = volatility index ⤴️🆙⬆️,
VIX up = Giant green GME dildo,
Buy the top, sell at the bottom. Just the same as every other index..,
Trading downside mean reversion strategies on the VIX has incredible results, but there's no free lunch of course. The trade off is that actually trading the VIX can be difficult because it's not like you can buy or sell VIX shares. You either have to trade VIX options or futures, but you're essentially a derivative of a derivative of a derivative so it can be difficult to have consistency.,
If you look at a chart of the VIX over the last year, every spike has immediately been crushed. [Comparing VIX with SPY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/z9q3ImaK/), buying the dip doesn't always work out in the short-term, but shorting the VIX has.  
When you consider elevated option premiums due to the spike in vol, it's been generally more advantageous to wait for vol to die back down _and then_ buy longer-dated calls on any dip. We've also seen pretty vicious bounce-backs in the 1-3 days after a dip so that's worked some of the time as well.,
I was hoping to find out what happens to VIX, not the S&P.

Long-dated UVXY calls when it was kickin around 16 were mispriced.  I bought some Dec 3 back in September and just waited, got out on Friday with my 200% gain,
TDLR: Big VIX spike = Big raging bulls coming to play,
I bought $24p dec 1st let’s fucking go boys,
VIX spikes are almost always a 1 day event.  if we have a 2-3 day duration, we be fuked.  Even in a correction they tend to be single day events, followed by 1-2 day drops, then another spike.  Even in March when it hit 80, spikes tended to be followed by dips then more spikes.  it always reverts to mean,
Goes back down...lol,

Thank goodness this not so dangerous variant was another excuse to dump some stock in clear desperation for margin requirements. I know what stocks I’m watching!,
Shorting the Vix when it's chasing new highs is my favorite play.,

Small cap health insurance company that's down 72% since its IPO last March and losing money.

What are you, an insider?,
You win an OSCaR for having a 5 cent loss be a 25% loss.,

I literally forgot "cyber monday" existed,
I just had three beers and I think I could take that cow.,
big dip buyers are going all in,
good, fuck those red coats,
Was just about to make a post about this. After what we saw yesterday I wouldn’t be surprised if the market dipped again on Monday. Especially since Friday was a short trading day.,
You forgot to add a caption when the Bull comes for round 2 that reads “buy the dip pussy! “,
Exactly! There are already reports from Africa that our vaccines work against this new variant that sent the market down a 1000 points yesterday. So Monday morning the Bulls will be kicking ass! ♉ 🐂,
I hope the SP 500 recoveres and it was just panic.

I bought when they were deeply red some calls with a KNockout value. Assuming it doesn not drop to 4150 and it recoveres I make a bundle.

Playmoney...just a couple of hundreds....but still.....KO Calls are EXCITING!

Unfortunately I seem not to be able to buy the cool kind of options you can.,
I agree with anything RATM.  An award for you sir!,
Maybe. Dude wins on Tuesday.,
Are those my PYPL calls?,
Wasn’t expecting the second one. Ouchy!!,

Not his day😜,
It was just meant to be.,
This is the OOOFFFFF!,
Great band and great song,
Bull market wins,
CyberMonday + Cybersecurity = BB Moon,
the fact they keep going after the same guy kills me,
Dude in the yellow shirt came to the rescue like “come on brother”. And then second time the bull came charging he bounced out fast as hell,
Fuck with the bull...well you know.,

Market crash imminent,
stock market in general is down preparing for depression,

Love that the video is from Costa Rica xD,

That looks like my portfolio after Friday,
uwhhhhhh! now that's a bad day.
oh! he's wearing red!,
Shit, I thought today was cyber monday.,
It’s always the bull you don’t see.,
Got call spreads a month out. Hope that’s enough time.,
I love these videos of sick idiots getting what's coming to them. How can this animal cruelty be legal in this day and age,
I heard the biggest sale will be on stocks,
Time to go all in on CCL on the drop. Easy 5x in 2yrs,
Lol I hope so cause these last week was fucking murder.,

Internet in india needs to be regulated because there are too many religious fanatics who are ready to explode in public settings after watching unrelated memes about their prophets on WhatsApp.,
… do people here realize india basically said spacex has not even applied for a licence to operate a broad band service in India? That’s their main problem.

They are not saying they will ban spacex. All they are asking spacex is to apply for a licence before they start taking peoples money.,
Starlink ipo? I thought it was a couple years away… is there any news?,
Will be interesting to see how counties that fight space internet fair.,
Mods just wants his slice. Cmon. See VISA,

It’s crazy how excited I get for Monday…only to wake up and I’m back to losing money again!,
“Heard you have a extra 2k to loose”,
I'm looking forward to more losses on Monday,
My TQQQ covered calls got assigned early on wednesday.  Feeling good.,
Yes please let me join,
where can i watch the futures?,
I'm 2 more hour long work meetings before I gain the strength to youtube 'How to trade futures'. Pray for me fellas,
they are watching hypnotoad great show,
red week for sure, RIP my $FCEL calls,
Best case scenario: gap down on Monday followed by a midday reversal. Would love to add at least one more time to a few of my positions,
Monday is gonna be another shit show,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
I hope they are up😅,
Hate weekends and holidays  # 24/7 365 stock market,
Weekend Dow, the only Dow that matters!,
Don’t worry cŷrpto markets are open 24/7!,
Full pls,
Lol,
24 hour trading....it's all 🖥.,
This is even funnier if you take it out of context,
I feel like we could be muy fucko on Monday so I am especially anxious.,
Present!  
I'm so retarded to look at futures already knowing the market is closed and fantasize the number,
crypto...,
It’s about to rip! Or a DCB? What you all think?,
When you hate weekends your life truly sucks.,

Soo I guess this means the US got lucky by selling reserve oil when they did?,
Guess WHO will show their middle finger to US now,
Not surprised.

Remember folks, the Saudi exchange was closed on Friday.  They're basically 'catching up' to what happened in New York on Friday.

Oil also dropped 10%, which is basically the Saudi stock market in a nut shell.

If it only drops 5%, I'd consider this a bull indicator.,
Hope gas gets cheaper from this,
This article is already fake and gay.  Oil is giant green dildos tomorrow.  The omicron headline was to shake out paper hands for the whales to buy in oil for cheap before the imminent bull run,
The introduction of the Xi variant came in at a really “convenient” time for the administration, they can show that their actions are bringing down oil prices, and also refill their reserves at this lower price. 


This ~~Nu~~ Xi variant will be a dud and South African doctors already confirmed that even though this has mutations. The symptoms are not threatening and just mild such as fatigue.,

Oh my Gourd, my winter berry futures contracts. I'll be financially ruined,
Great analysis OP, but I feel like youre leaving out a crucial corner of the pie market that doesnt seem to be getting much attention, and is a year round commodity.

The Pot Pie and Meat Pie markets remain relatively cozy in their niche, but with the new Pi variant, no pie is safe. 

Im currently shorting Chicken Pot Pie(which many think im crazy for, i mean, who bets against chicken pot pie?)
and Shepards Pie. 


This is my YOLO.,
This is why I joined this sub .,
Looks like Conagra $CAG is the largest frozen pie seller.  Puts is the play,
Flag as DD,
how much did big cake pay you to make this post?,
Damn maybe I'll need to be careful with my OnlyFlans,
Going long on the Hair Pies,
Does this happen on March 14th?,
However when the Pie virus breaks…. BlackBerry will rocket as a cure to the pie strain, those little prickles take anything down!,
It's the opposite effect. Corona beers actually increased sales during corona virus.

People think about pies they buy pies. Also there is always the easy joke that you have the pie.,
Can creampies reign supreme?,
I came here for this 👆,
Really thought this isn’t totally a shitpost. The public is retarded.,
You should just short dessert stocks across the board to cover your bases,
Do we think this will have an affect on weed pies?,
This is rock-solid DD, like the guy who blew his wad with a [101.25% loss on Levi's calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/) because he thought pandemic would make everyone fat so they'd need to buy new jeans.,
Tried to short cake, ended up long shortcake. Was going to roll the position out into a shortbread, wound up short bread.  I hate this bakery.,
Calls on DNUT got it,
Math will also crash so buy puts on math book publishers and Texas Instruments.,
I know this is a joke, but seeing as how Corona lost business at the beginning of the pandemic because of their name, there's a tiny bit of truth to this.,
Apple will go down 3.14 immediately,
My cheesecake factory calls will finally print!,
Why did they skip XI when naming variants …,
Calzones will take a significant hit as well.,
Too late - already priced in. You need to be two steps ahead, that’s why I’m shorting dicks sporting good and other companies that sell rowing machines.

iFit saw the COVID on the wall and decided to cancel it’s IPO because of this.,
You're going into the Christmas holiday season and you're *shorting* pie stocks? People are stupid, but people also love pies more than they ever loved a lager brand.,
As a man who makes pies, please don’t short my pies. Please. Won’t you short, perhaps, my cakes? Would you please short my cakes. I’ve done the DD on ShortCakes.,
There are people nearby who are very confused about why the Omicron restaurant is in the news right now.,
PUTS ON PIES 🥧 💦,
Puts on Entemans?,
something something Marie Callender’s shorts,
Not to be confused with Tesla pi, which will be a game changer,
Puts on Cheesecake.,
I agree. We also need to be weary of massive suppie chain issues that could cause a rise in prices,
Don't dare short my Christmas mince pies!!! I love them with fresh cream, yummy 😋,
Counterpoint: I just bought a 3 pack of Pi Picos. I think these chips are very useful and are chips. Bullish on Pi,
I'm thankful for all the kind ladies out there who leave pies on their windowsills so an old chunk of coal like me might have a meal from time to time.,
So puts on BB?,
Is there a pie etf?,
We already saw that Anheuser-Busch didn't tank as a result of the *corona*virus. I think it was even shown that Corona sales went up during the pandemic. Basically, bullish on pie,
Just leave my aapl pie alone,
All in on pumpkin pie futures,
Mooning with Moonpie puts,
To bad the WHO skipped Xi. Nothing to see here. Move along...,
moon pies 🚀🚀🚀✨🌕✨🌕✨🌕✨,
Are cinnamon buns still safe?,
I’m going to buy pies now at high prices freeze them and then sell them low.,
This dd is solid gold, but 3.141265 free!,
What about quiches??,
Eating some pumpkin pie now. To protest,
What will happen all the formulas that use π,
Big brains over here,
People start avoiding mathematicians and round objects assuming they have the Pi varient,
Is this observable in stocks like corona beer or in delta airlines vs other airlines? I worked in spencers when the pandemic hit, and we quickly shipped in a ton of corona beer merchandise that sold pretty quickly.,
People are *that* stupid. It's amazing in a frustrating manner.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
phew, thank god i'm safe with pizza,
Are cream pies something to stay away from? Or are they a strong play like my wife’s boyfriend says?,
My Dragon Berry Pies!!!! Noooooooo!!!,
I don't see creampie on this list. Is it safe?,
Our blood sugars are fucked,
Does this include pizza pie,
Damn if it is not true.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Shrimp and fries, do or dye,
well if it dips i am buying if it dips more i am buying more,
Pies only go up,
This guy plans, and f them pies,
I wish more of these made it to the main page lmao,
Too late for me to buy the pumpkin pie dip for thanksgiving….,
if rhubarb is fruit then im a monkey's uncle,
Puts on Little Debbie,
Calls on krispykream, got it,
Sounds about as American as Apple pie!! You know what else fees like apple pie!! Looks like we are fucked!! 😂 🥧,
POoo pooo pie makes me poo poo,
Tickers please honey 💅,
$CAKE down -4% bruh,
Please Ban this Mod,
I especially like the idea to long the doughnuts. I'm already seeing output from the middle east becoming more prevalent, even having Persian Doughnuts on the Walmart donut rack. Though small, I see it rising.,
What the fucking pie are you talking about?!,
Puts on Sara Lee!,
when COVID first hit... I actually thought that sales of Corona beer would increase because I thought people would buy it as a joke. I was surprised when people actually specifically didn't buy Corona beer.,
Oh shit my cranberry sprite options will be ruined I tell ya! DOOOMED!,
Pie sales have risen steadily in the run up to Thanksgiving, and I predict they will continue on their trend afterwards. Solid momentum play.,
Golden,
Just wait until we have to short cake,
Solid. Thanks man this is my yolo now too. See you on the tendie train, I owe you hand job.,
Oh no, the schmauzberries won’t taste like schnauzberries when this happens!,
I'm shortbread,
Welp... time to buy DNUT again...,
What happened to Corona Beer?,
*Sweats in Vanilla bean ice cream*,
I will never pienancially recover from this.,
You’re joking but some people will actually be scared of pies. 😂,
What happened to the Xi stocks? They skipped that variant and china stocks still falling. Not is immune,
The odds of this being correct are higher than they should ever deserve to be.,
Are fish egg markets next? I don’t speak Greek.,
The funniest thing to me remains people who believed that COVID was caused by Corona light beer and wouldn’t drink it. Equally as surprising were people who believed Corona light gave COVID to people BUT still wanted to drink it anyway. The fact that some people seriously sat down and valued a shitty tasting beer over their own continued existence was interesting,
Cake futures > Gourd futures,
oh god not the pie futures,
Covid, Covid Delta, Covid Omicron. Next is probably Covid Theta,
I will single handedly keep pie stores open by consuming a vast amount of apple pie.,
This is the DD I came for,
Will peach cobbler be safe ?,
I’m doing Puts in all the Porn stocks I can because they are always listing Cream pies…,
My stock literally has a 28% dark pool short interest. Which i think is bad but not sure, still sounds scary.,
What about  the tesla the pie phone.,
Top notch DD. Thanks for sharing.,
I welcome our new Domino overlord...just bring cheesy sticks,
Dude, are pecans going to be ok? I'm worried ASF right now!!,
Short $PIE ETF? Lol,
Better due diligence than most posts.,
GG Black Berry,
Short AAPL, got it.,
Reversing you might be the best decision I've ever made,
The cream pie business is busting,
Impinj, Inc. ($PI) just dropped $2.80 in Friday's trading session to $74.22. Oh my, it's starting!,
Shorting Impinj Monday. Good luck apes.,
Pie stonks only go up. 🌈🧸,
Wtf,
time to look into the 2 minite noodle ETF.,
What about Cheesecake?  It has 'cake' in the name, but it is closer to pie in actuality.,
Pies only go up 🚀,
That guy who shorted South Africa is sitting pretty right about now...,
Twankies on my truck mane hold up.,
Going long key lime futures. It’s gonna be the next squeeeeezzee,
I just want my pie,
Why is there a shitpost flair on this DD,
Plus pie sales have been artificially boosted due to Thanksgiving. Even without the new Covid strain I'd stay away from pie stocks.,
RC and Moon Pie 🚀,
I always short pies at about Thanksgiving afternoon. That's usually close to peak demand.,
Pass the weed son. You on some ish bruh 😎,
Like I feel like this is a troll post. But didn’t corona beer suffer heavily ?,
Legit. look what happened to corona beer? Who is still drinking that?,
This is genius and so logical, I love this sub,
I love reverse ingesting apples (stuffing them into my bum),
Will this affect my frozen orange juice concentrate futures?,
Its so stupid it might actually work,
Left leaning Americans are delusional. Right leaning Americans are borderline autistic. Both are equally stupid and clueless.,
Don't forget all the math stocks,
Agreed. Public stoopid.,
So buy the dip? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up),
Watch this post actually happen,
This is the quality content I stick around for.,
So my long position in the North Atlantic salmon futures market should be safe?,
will Cheesecake Factory be safe? or all in on Puts until it hits 0. Is cheesecake a pie??,
Puts on PIEzer.,
Double win for me, I’ll sell you puts that never print..and I get to laugh my ass all the way to the bank.

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
We skipped over e, f, g, h, I, j, k, l, m and n so who’s to say we don’t skip pie and the next one is Z,
What else is a good buy besides rice bran?,
this is too funny you win at the internet today sir,
Well since its supposed to be Xi it explains why china stock market is going to pot,
Head and shoulders on the daily for the ticker $PIE as well. Looks like this pie oppression is going to hit emerging markets first.,
Starts to horde several pumpkin pies and grabs a gallon of Cool Whip!,
puts on Sara lee,
Raspberry Pi?,
Pikachu?,
I'm seriously not worried until we discover the Sigma ~~chad~~ variant,
Swine flue was terrible for the pork industry, even though pigs had nothing to do with spreading the flu at that point.,
I already bet against TWNK and lost. But I’ll do it again. For the cause.,
I am long on Greggs, you are just too stupid to see the upside,
Is $CAKE a buy sell or hold?,
B   A   K   E   D   I   N,

I'm only mad because everyone is going to shit once markets open on Monday,
I’m fooked. Selling at a loss at market open.,
Buying puts isn't shorting anything.  I'm long SPY puts too🔥🔥🔥🔥,
You should have covered Friday. Monday is probably going to be a rally,
OP is fuk.,
For one moment I thought you wrote QQQ puts since you said “shorted”,
Why would you short QQQ? Don't you know Jpow is going to keep printing for another 4 years,
You are so fucked. Good luck.,
Good chance will see a rebound all around Monday. Planning to short qqq right before close. I see more downside (370-375) for another week. Whatever you do, do not short TESLA. Don’t fucking do it.,
On what basis? Variant good/bad? Debt ceiling good/bad? Other?,
are you using a custom font?,
I advise selling by tomorrow afternoon regardless if you're in a profit. Even if you're right, the whole market isn't going to stay down very long.,
You *do know* there's a SQQQ that does the opposite of what QQQ does? It was up 5.9% last day vs. QQQ being down 1.9%. It's a 3x leveraged variant of QQQ that goes short on the same index, but is managed to return maximum gains. If you want to short QQQ, just go long on SQQQ instead because it will perform WAAAY better.,

Lol

Dorsey for president

He would get less then Kamala did,
Dorsey couldn’t make fucking twitter turn a profit, so he’s good for America?  Makes sense..,
Shitpost, linked to a shitpost, linked to a shitpost, linked to some guy’s unsourced YouTube video. I’m sold.,
Dorsey is a censorship scumbag and word is he was under investigations for multiple sexual assault claims at his work by former employees,
I thought everyone hated Dorsey. There is no chance Biden runs again though, I'd be surprised if he lasted the full 4 years before stepping down. 

I guess the first thing Dorsey would do would be to repeal the first amendment.,
This is idiotic. Democrats are extremists, republicans are extremists. Just give me a moderate like that nice young man running North Korea.,
No really…. This would work out just fine. Trust me bro,
Fuking toolbag. He can take his censorship and stuff it.,

Got some leaps before earnings. They killed it.  
Looking forward to profitable next quarter!,
I think that I was right for the first time ever,
Up 7% today!,
You bought at the top, didn't ya?,

Any solid fundamentals that you're basing this on? You've basically said fuckall,
Why post a DD and then get offended when people ask questions??,
Wen moon?,
Reading these comments has made me realize OP is such an incredible moron that I am now rethinking my bullish position on GENI,
Opened a position a shade over $10 last week and bought some December calls in the low teens. Agree this is oversold.,
Well it’s under $10 now (9.76).  Every timeline I bring up wether day, week, month, year or Max shows it as a loss.   
That’s a dark horse you’re (all-in) holding there.,
I'd be interested in catching it on the up.

I put in an alert for 10.15,
Offended because DKNG the goat,

So they charged 4 minutes faster to 50% I wouldn't call that a significant difference. And allowable charge rates have alot to do with battery life management.  Lucid may very well be accepting faster battery life loss. In order to put up a more impressive charge rate now,
Faster charging means faster wear on the batteries.,
Just think in a year they might have 1/30th the number of Tesla chargers. Truly incredible.,
Where's Cathy once she jumps in its over, i mean MOON time!!!,
It's the old same battery tech Tesla uses. Tesla actually has new battery tech rolling out in some models now. I believe Tesla is probably over valued 40% but LCID is more like 75% over valued.,
This is a function of the larger pack. It only reaches 2.5C charging, while the best of Tesla’s packs hit 3.1C.,
LCID to the moonnnn,
Lcid puts go brrr. Eat shit retards,
I love the car,  I hate the stock.... lol ... oil profits helped me buy my tesla and will continue to fund my lifestyle with dividends.   When the tesla Bubble pops you will all ask about why they didn't use lube.,
Why people sleeping on polestar,
I would only buy number 1 i.e Tesla car, considering i have that kindda money, i feel comfortable with so many people already using tesla. Unless lucid launches similar model in half the price then i can buy lucid, similar price similar model i will always buy tesla just because its more time tested on a new tech which wasn’t around 10-15 years ago…,
Yea but how many deliveries has lucid done?,
These Lucid’s are so sexy to me. I am looking forward to when these become a little easier to get. I am planning to make one of these my first electric car.,
Cool that an ex-Tesla model S engineer improved upon a design he had an intimate knowledge of, fine tuned that tech on the race track then came back to make a 170k hand made car besting the model S(for a little while anyway)....the real challenge will be that 77K car in volume they have planned.  By then Tesla will be mass producing 3-5 million cars/year, have working level 5 autonomy and who knows what the rest of the car industry will be doing....but sure Lucid is worth more than Ford and is undervalued as the value is infinite according to the CEO.  smh,
Yeah but price doesn’t sound sexy,
My shares in $LCID are the benefits of my initial investment, so I'm going to ride the wave eating popcorn watching it go to the moon and beyond!!!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
[deleted],
I wouldn't buy lucid if it was the last stock on the market,
Nio, tesla, xpeng are all far better choices than the ridiculously over valued lucid,
134kw 🤨,

Lol,
Stfu ..its 💩💩💩💩💩💩🤡🤡🤡🤡,
Bots and shills...I call Luxid 💩💩💩💩💩💩 Response?? What you got to say LMAO
that's what I thought !!! Its 💩💩💩💩💩 
ONLY GME ..THE REAL company  I like,
My mistake was that I took profit and was waiting to get down to buy more shares but couldn’t so far.,
Remember when we couldn’t talk about this because it was a SPAC?  Pepperidge farms remembers.,
Relax with the jacked tits with lcid. The EV landscape started to be saturated with other dozens of companies. Whoever makes EV that can be afforded by many takes the lion's share. So far, here in the US, Tesla still leading. Then comes Ford and GM, the Japs and chinese brands and other small players that builds EVs for the masses.,
Just curious, if all these manufacturers make different chargers with different voltages, can the same chargers be used on all of the cars or will we have an Apple/Samsung situation here?,
That's the equivalent of removing all the car seats excepts the drivers in order to get the car lighter and faster.,
Which doesn't matter the slightest till they prove they can make and sell cars at volume,
It’ll be like Android 2010, obviously better but no one will want one,
Don't you think that EV euphoria will fade and eventually these will just be valued as normal car companies since EV will be the standard?,
Actual collectors items would be high end ice cars like porsches or hellcats that will be discontinued.

Lucid to $25 by June 2022,
Faster charging battery on a lesser electric car. That’s like saying, “Hey! My phone charges faster than yours!”…”What phone do you have?”… “A Google Pixel!”…. “Oh, good for you….”,
Rivian suv and trucks. Who was buying sedans before? Or efuel keep your gas engine at zero carbon foot print.,
More range and faster charging than Tesla…,
You absolutely don't daily drive an EV if you focus on the fast charge speed. If you are a normal driver with home charging the few times you do fast charge it's on a road trip where after going from 100-20 you are ready for a meal or break. And 35 to 45 minute difference doesn't really matter.,
Are people really still buying sedans?,
Lucid Air is an amazing ev car . Peter Rawlinson and his team are doing an excellent job all around . That battery of the Air the Range is insane the only -CON i see as an investor is the price of the stock is super overvalued. The Lucid Air Performance with 1,111 HP is insane too . Remember can be an amazing product battery range and all of that the issue is the financials.  Stay +Revenue , +Net Income and LCID is far far away from Tesla but i agree OP the battery of Lcid Air is special no doubt .,
so making a slightly faster car (just the one per day on a good day, btw) justifies somehow the share price tag?,
worth at least 300b now, simply because of this. 😐,
After the initial run of bloggers, influencers , and rich people who just need everything new nobody is going to buy these overpriced cars .

Lucid is irrelevant in the EV world for another 3-5 years until we see how they pivot when they realize the EV target market is going to be under $55k retail price targets . If they can’t hook up to the Tesla supercharger network they are dead,

I was about to buy some vanguard ETFs but your post got me back on track.

Buying stocks I don't have any clue about briefly mentioned in WSB sub by someone who's most likely a long term bag holder,
I buy PLTR on a regular basis and don’t care what the price is because one day PLTR will be skynet and I’ll be rich. If not i die as broke as I am today. Oh well,
Free education?,
Aka How to polish a turd,
OP is not the hero we deserve, but OP is the hero we need.,
Can't go wrong with WISH,
Let's fuckin go OP. How much PLTR you own is the truest mark of a man,
OP gets me!! I always choose the losers 😭,
sounds reasonable, lots of nice emojis

all in on PLTR,
Also remember that all stocks will instantly shoot up once you sell. Dammit SJM.,
Remember, you only DATE stocks, NEVER Marry one!!,
I bought T and VZ in 2016 for the dividends.  They have given me that.  Thought they might go up some too.  I mean isn't that market up like 100%.  🤷🏻,
If you think the difference between 4% down and 3% down is a gain of 1%, you're certainly on the right track.  You should buy more OTM leap calls.,
This is definitely financial advice,
It me,
I think I need to pay you instead of my therapist, can you prescribe medication though?,
I also have a retard-proof psychological hack for options. Even though I'm jacked to the tits with call options, i always make sure to buy a fractional share (~$1 worth) of any stock I'm optioning. This means that even if options expire worthless, i never am in a situation when I'd have to say that my position related to the given stock went to 0. I always have the fractional share left which has non-0 value. And since i can never lose everything, why wouldn't i always YOLO everything i have? Right?,
The quality of the subreddit has been volatile.,
Palantards unite! Hold strong! Papa Karp will lead us through these tough times!,
First never bet more then 10% of your investment account in one stock but 5% is better and buy the support floors and sell the rip rinse and repeat.,
This also applies to the following; CLOV CRSR RKT,
Good guide. Sounds just like ARK way,
if your investing methodology fails, just buy pant stocks.  Everyone needs pants.,
I capitulated on CRSR and PLTR the other day. Sticking with stocks that actually go up from now on. Currently in FB, NET, AMD, NVDA.,
Thanks will help men,
Or just go and buy the future of healthcare, CLOV. Stupid ducks with their DD. Well I guess I'm more retarded for listening to them,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
WISH exhibited some downward volatility as of late.  You know what else exhibited volatility?  Amazon, ever heard of it?,
Fucking lol

Top kek fellow Palintard,
So happy you used an example that is directly relevant to my portfolio so that I could fully comprehend. 

Next time some tic toc vids with graphics would be nice. It's hard to digest these complex concepts with words I can barely read.,
Aye aye, Captain, stonks only go up !!,
Buying 100 $BIG on monday,
Forgot to mention never sell at a loss,
*scribbles notes in crayon*,
Karp gave the janitor 50 million shares while you typed that,
$PLTR is currently trading at 42 x revenue, it is grossly overvalued, an overvalued company  will generally either trade sideways until its business grows to catch up with valuation or it will correct to a more reasonable valuation,
SNDL looks over sold,
Tbh... You could have made decent $ buying the dips on PLTR and selling ~$27/sh,
LOL 2023 $15 calls.
.
I HAD 2023 $50 CALLS B1TCH,
Saved for the long haul.,
You can always look at the moons and stars to seek guidance moonchild.,
Shooting star is entrance candle,
Absolute best decision of my trading career was dumping all of my PLTR into GME.  On 2/24 when it rose again.,
Sndl at the moment and the all hated hood,
wow, thanks for the help! gonna invest my life savings in pltr now,
I like to eenie meenie miney mo my investments,
Do WISH and BB next!,
lol I've been wheeling PLTR and probably made like 20% from the wheel YTD (yeah still lags market but atleast something),
Step 2: Compare your stock to the market only when it benefits you.

For example, PLTR closed down 0.4% on Friday. I could say, "PLTR was down on Friday." However, SPY was also down 2.27% on the same day.

This shit step is popular among etoro popular investors. They will say: My portfolio down 1%, spy down 2%. Face palm,

Tomorrows Headlines: WSB now betting on UFO stocks.,
This guy has an 8 year old account, pops up for this one post to warn us

I’m in,
Is more booze and ammo the wrong answer? because so far its my biggest portfolio.,
I have a bunch of UFO stocks in my portfolio. I see them. Problem is my broker denies seeing them. 
But once this comes out to light, and everyone starts seeing how rich I am, I'll be rich. 
Until then, I'm prepared,
Lockheed Martin stock for the eventual Independence Day type war,
LMT - Lockheed Martin/ skunkworks has been producing the next generation of fighters with NOC- Northrop Grumman. Both should do well with the UFO news.  Both have good earnings and low entry price. If this market crash keeps going they will be good turnaround plays.,
Siri: how do i invest in UFOs,
I did some great DD over the weekend watching movies, and now know ET likes Reese’s Pieces!,
If aliens have the technology to get here, they have the technology to not be seen,
Virgin Galactic will never lose its V card. 

So many better space plays. 

RKLB
ASTR
SPIR
RDW
VLD,
You're onto something partner. I've already factored this into my portfolio.


I believe the ETs will be peaceful. I came to this conclusion based on tech they've already provided Earth.


There will still be a quick run on defense stocks until Earth at large recognizes their intentions I reckon.


What will 100% happen is mass pants-shitting world-wide. It's going to be a river of FUD swirling around in a lot of heads.


Especially religious heads and that's a stupidly huge market. ET ain't heard of Jesus and he ain't never preached no UFO shit.



Calling huge demand for deprogramming and rewiring to the new reality. Psychedelic stocks are my safe play for the ETs.,
Guns up, let’s do this! LEEROY JENKINS!!!
Buy all the defense stocks,
puts on aliens,
All the alien tech from Roswell was given to the private sector because gov't scientists weren't smart enough to figure it out. The fucking Chinese probably have it now,  all they do is reverse engineer everyone else's shit. Specifically the anti gravity drive like used in the tic-tac videos.,
UFO’s just fly past earth they know we got Covid,
what makes you think the aliens give fuck about us tho? probably the same as us going to a zoo to check out the animals,
Are you suggesting that Virgin Galactic, which is not even capable of space travel in the strict sense, would be able to take up the gauntlet with some extraterrestrial technology that was advanced enough to reach the Earth from possibly several light years away?
Edit: even the thought process is stupid. Do you think many people would want to travel in space knowing that there are some UFOs lurking around with literally zero chance of accountability if they decided to shoot down a spacecraft?,
As soon as the UFO is seen it becomes an FO. 

Once it lands it's just an O. 

Calls on Forestar Group and Realty Income Corp?,
Calls on LMT, Raytheon and spaceX (if it’s get listed) plus any Chinese and Russian rocket/defense companies. Not advise,
Maybe an alien will sponsor a spac,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)

He knows lol,
I’ve stocked up on M&M’s. The food of extraterrestrials….am
imaging myself,
Yo I’m down in Florida on the gulf side and everyday after lunch jets spray x’s  up in the sky and lay down long ass streams that fog up the whole sky. Maybe they are hiding something?,
r/UFOs redditor here. 

The future isn't solar or wind, it's certainly not fossil fuels. Once nuclear fusion, high temp super conductors, gravity wave emitters -- all three currently patented by the US NAVY -- are unveiled for industrial scaling, that's the time to invest in companies that already exist in that space. 

UFO stocks are actually just stocks in alien technologies that have been brought to public consumption since the 1940s (e.g. GPS, transistors, the internet). However, the switch to the big 3 UFO tech will be gang busters and completely dismantle and rebuild our economy -- which is currently centered around petroleum and the petrol dollar. Once all that fails, the government is gonna be like  whoopsies but here is all this transformative tech to completely reshape society. 

So yeah, bet on UFO stonks.,
Quack quack,
Lol theyre probably drones being tested against the best pilots. #lockheed,
I bought shares of Canadian space company MDA on this big dip. I also own shares of RKLB and LMT. I really like the idea of investing in the space industry and believe there will be an inflow of money into the industry within the next few years, and going forward. It may end up creating a bubble, considering most of these companies will not be net positive for years, if ever.,
These UAP reports stem from approximately 2004 to now. The government’s are only releasing them recently due to the lack of stigma in today’s age. And considering that we might not have had the tech to see them earlier who knows how long the UAPs have been among us. If the UAPs haven’t made a move on us in nearly 20 years they might not make a move in the next 20 years. Don’t expect any major reactions from the stock market until shit really hits the fan,
RDW,
Already here,
Defense stocks?  


Not my play, those would probably get nationalized worldwide if the threat is big enough.

&#x200B;

Maybe booze and maybe ammo stocks, traditional ammo. The day that occurs first there would be hope and optimism but the sooner we realize that they can wipe us as we wipe ant colonies, well its gonna go south at relativistic speeds.,
Nitinol and fibre optics stocks. Oh and David Wilcox says he has come up w an anti grav vehicle, prepping to release to the public. 🤧,
TLDR: $UFO to the moon! Got it.,
Do not worry.

Got Buck Rogers on freeze.,
Shoot them down and salvage all the exotic materials and tech. It’s worth a fortune.,
Raytheon. 

Source: I am a Moose who sees UFOS.,
If UFOs and aliens are real and already here, then there are bigger problems to worry about than your portfolio. I guess it all depends on what the intentions are and if an invasion is eminent. Because if it is, our markets/money won’t mean shit.,
Wsb is riddled with idiots but this is gold. Maybe buy gold, aliens may need it and intergalactic trading will make it soar. I knew there had to be at least one person watching History channel's UFO encounters and is believing it I just thought it'll be someone old, gully and without internet access.,
I wrote a WSB post about the connection between UFOs and defense companies. It got a good amount of attention and I’m glad you’re raising awareness. [Here Is The Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9zlpn/important_connection_between_ufos_and_defense/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf),
Is this satire?,
UFO?,
About 8% of human dna is made from dna collected from viruses. What if God is an “alien” and evolution is real? Covid is just another step up the ladder for us and after we’re done evolving it’ll be time for us to ascend to heaven…so in short space is cold as fuck invest in aerogel insulation companies and dehydration tech for the space ice cream,
I genuinely love this thought process… does that mean an end to the shithousery of humans?,

Whose to say the money hasn't already been made from past harvested crashes? Philip Corso wrote in 'The Day After Roswell', the remnants were distributed to industrial leaders that lead to advances in stealth, night vision, light weight materials.,
I see it as another boogy-man being waved about by the federal government to distract us from real issues, and to create increased defense spending now that we've drawn down a couple more war zones. Gotta keep those contractors fat and happy or the economy will crash completely and the Senate shareholders will have to give up a page boy or three.,
This is either US tech or US psychological games…and all our allies are playing along.

Gotta give our strategic threats a reason to think twice about fukkin with the US/allies.,
I don’t see defense contractors using airplanes that can’t go into space. Satelite company’s might be a better pitch. I believe there was an article on nasa doing defense against an asteroid. 

https://phys.org/news/2021-11-nasa-spacecraft-asteroid.html,
Calls on UFO are cheap AF right now,
What options we getting lol,
Most likely that is China in the skies. Surely some sector in the government knows what this is and are already prepared for it. The publicity stunt is probably a tactic of some sort. The goal of that stunt? Remains unknown.

But betting your portfolio on this bullshit is the most retarded thing you can do. Makes me question your sanity.,
UFO's must be destroyed.  Load up on $XAR,
Is there stock for CERN or physicists?,
No better or worse than most of the advice on here 🤣,
Ok what tickets we talking about for the ufo hedge?,
If anyone finds out who made those memory zappers from men in black, I’m all in on that company.,
No one would give a shit about most alien contact scenarios. The only scenarios that matter are ones where they want to open economic relations (ie trade, in which case tech stocks take a dive but commodities do ok) or they seek to impose their will on us (all bets are off since it depends entirely on their objectives which are not knowable).

Knowing that their are aliens would have the same effect as knowing that there are black holes. Interesting to some, most of whom are already convinced that the universe harbours intelligent life somewhere, a brief novelty to others and trivia to most.,
Don’t forget $KTOS.,
No aliens will ever survive contact with humanity.

Any aliens advanced enough to visit us will be too civilized to destroy us on contact. No matter weather they make peace with or enslave us humanity will eventually adapt, overcome, and exterminate the alien race in brutal systematic xenocide.

Humans are space orcs.

Finding evidence of alien life would give us the common enemy needed to unite the world into a war machine that will light the skys on fire with the cleansing fires of human achievement.,

Idiots, I already have a UFO stock.  It's called $NKLA.,
OP, if you think they are real then why not bet on Meta (FB) because Zuckerberg is most likely one of them. It’s possible he’s building the metaverse so that we can all be plugged into the Matrix. And those of us who become rich will be someone important in the metaverse, like an actor.,
Corridor crew on YouTube debunked some of these as camera flaws and they’re professional vfx artists.,
Long on UFO OTM’s,
Aliens,
SpaceX is private, retard.,
Calls on shaky home videos where you can't see shit.,
Go long on $ROPE and price gouge all the religious fanatics who don’t know how to cope with the conflicts between religion and not being the only sentient species in the universe,
Raytheon calls boys goes brrr with the new hypersonic interceptor This is the way. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
It's controlled messaging.,
They will never admit aliens, otherwise all christans who believe god made them by his face is wrong and this would prove once and for all that there os jo jesus. Imagine suicides christans would be doing,
Reminds me of the cold war when the US would leak information of about these far out weapons we supposedly had to make Russia go out and try to replicate it and burn through tons of money.

The US, UK, and Australia have an objective here completely unrelated to UFO's and we just can't see it.,
You can contact the Blink 182 guy about To the Stars Academy. I think they were selling stock privately, hehehe,
Calls on $AMMO $SPCE $LMT,
The notion that Space X and Virgin Galactic or even the most powerful and advanced nation-states on the planet could "defend" our "local" space against anyone with the technology to cross the vastness of space just to get here in the first place, is laughable.,
If I were betting on it I’d be guessing a huge sell off.,
UFOs made DFEN go from 20 to 25 and got priced in.,
Let’s do this! What we betting on?,
As long as this world has 100 different space companies and countries with different goals nothing is gonna happen in terms of space.
Just imagine we get to Mars what then? Every country becomes a % of Mars according to their earth size? 
Is the Us going to yoink it all sparking a war with china and Russia? Is it the other way around? 
As long as humanity doesn't combine their efforts that shit is not gonna happen.

Or do you think aliens would mind talking to 250+ leaders,
If there are aliens here on earth, they’re peaceful  because we’re not dead yet.

I doubt they’re here. You can deduce what “they know” based on what “they” invest in. Right now we are gearing up for WW3. It’s easier to tell by looking at the UK because the US is already so big the delta doesn’t stand out. But the UK does. They’re manoeuvring with intent. And billionaires are all prepping their New Zealand lair. Fate is laid out, it just hasn’t happened yet.,
Yeah I’ve been hearing rumors defense stocks are the move for the alien reveal 👽🛸,
all ready balls deep in RYCEY,
I wondered about this as well. Thered be a kneejerk selloff on fear, but what would rip? As we saw in covid, there are winners in every situation. My gut thinks defense contractors as well as theyll likely get some sort of pact to share technology. NOC, LMT etc. 

Beyond that, i would have the assume that if they are friendly then they are hear to share technologies. Green energy perhaps? Software?

If they aren’t friendly the money you spent wont matter anyway so might as well YOLO,
i bought TTSA from them, i dunno if i ever will see the money back since its not traded. i dont care one bit though, we need to support disclosure,
A race so advanced they can travel the vast distances of space to find another sentient population, allows themselves to be spotted through the “rudimentary” methods we have at our disposal? I’d have to assume any alien race performing reconnaissance on Earth would do so in extreme stealth, and choose when to identify their presence. 

This UFO is probably some secret project the US or some other large military budget country is running. Either way, if I was a US general in charge of this project and people are claiming to see weird shit in the sky, deny till you die and “oh we see that too….hmmm weird right?”,
Go long $UFO 🦍🛸,
Does this mean the $UFO [ETF](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UFO:US) is going to appreciate now because Reddit said so?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Space X isn’t a publicly traded company,
Alien metals (ticker UFO) a sure bet. I'm down 20% so a rally due to an invasion would be most welcome,
Feds desperately trying to downvote this post away and say it never happened,
Don’t buy the hype. Short the market.,
I mean honestly why else would the Fed have the green light to print unlimited $$?? Either they are the dumbest mf’s alive or something gave them permission. It’s a 50/50 toss up for me,
Lockheed Martin because Skunkworks,
If these ufos exist defense spending won’t matter at all. We are insignificant technologically wise to them. First we ask to be friends, if they say no, then we ask to be left alone, if they say no, then finally we ask to be their slaves. There is no circumstance where we fight and end up anything but quickly eradicated.,
When public perception shifts, it will be revealed that the government has been reverse engineering this stuff for decades and can now release it to all firms to study, then cool yeah. Good bet.

If the shift occurs and the government goes "yeah mate idk what that is" then we are already decades/centuries behind technology wise so unless the aliens decide to share, we have to carry on as normal

Not investing in some random space companies. Maybe when SpaceX finally goes public (after Elon returns home to Mars),
is this CIA shill seeing how traders will react to alliens?

i would invest in goods, jewelry, etc..  aliens might want to buy souvenirs or shiny human made goods.

considering though that the fuel required to power their space craft to even GET to earth is rare (in the whole galaxy kinda rare) to begin with to traverse the span of the galaxy in an hour or so..  Maybe at the most we would get a few cargo ships to sell to the aliens in exchange for gold or goods like helium3 or even alien made artwork or similar souvenirs made by aliens. I doubt they would trade any technological bounties or exotic materials. Otherwise they might cut us out of their trade routes..

&#x200B;

Though they MIGHT give us exotic tech for clean energy but we kinda already know how (fusion tech). I would get the fuck out of oil stocks and short the shit out of it. Invest in astroid mining, farmland, hydroponic farming, and invest everything in healthcare and genetics like crispr etc..,
There's a shit teir penny stock mining company in the UK with the ticker £UFO. Are you saying this will pump?,
I'm all in for the "Intergalactic Trade Alliance",
Thanks for the advice… I should’ve bought puts on UFO last week. I’d have actually made a couple dollars.,
Didn’t we already had an UFO post back in May?,
The news cycle has died since competent individuals took power. The UFO news cycle is at least a decade old information that's been vetted and is boring. But fluff sells. UFOs and bigfoot are fluff pieces that get ratings when real news isn't drawing crowds.,
Are you sure it's not just the US Military bragging bout their latest top secret plane to the Russians?,
Bro the Gov't tried to roll out these reports last year as well as a distraction the exact same shit.  It means nothing.  And people have been seeing UFOs for decades either you're already panicked about it or you just don't care.,

Ya I’m not participating. Stupid.,
The metaverse will have less than half the active user base as Twitter, which is less than 10% of the country.  The iPhone isn't going anywhere.,
How will I post WSB memes with glasses. 

Eww 🤮

Keeping me phone,
Pretty obvious we're going to just live in a digitally enhanced reality at some point. Went from computers that were stationary, to computers that were portable but bulky. Then they could fit in your pocket and on your wrist. Next you'll wear them on your face. Final form is the computer being directly attached to your brain and projecting onto your reality and interacting with your thoughts. CMV...,
People are going to leave reality to go live in a virtual reality world? That doesn’t sound psychologically healthy. I’ll go long on the mental health field,
It's funny to me seeing a bunch of technology using retards immediately become luddites when the tech iterates beyond their comfort level.

What did you morons think was coming next?,
Remember when google glass tried (and failed) to become a thing?,
Dude….those AR/VR headsets will need tons of processing power. Some of it will be onboard processing, but it makes much more sense to use remote resources. 

For the upcoming glasses, Apple will use a tethered phone for additional processing power.,
AR I think is more realistic to become popular than VR. I just don’t think people want to be cut off from the world entirely for huge portions of the day outside of hardcore gamers.

There are so many barriers though. People don’t like goofy glasses for one. And they won’t put contacts in all day.

Maybe you can convince people that are work from home to wear these during work hours and gamers to also wear headsets, but when it comes to socializing, I don’t really do it over Zoom.

Basically I think AR or VR will be used about as much as Zoom and video gaming are right now.,
I know there’s a lot of debate about what the metaverse will be, but we shouldn’t take it as false gospel. Tech companies are letting consumers know how they plan to continue growing through the next age of the Internet. Yes phones will still be around just like ‘60s cars, but most people want a Tesla,
The metaverse is one of the stupidest fucking ideas techbros have created in the last 25 years. It was literally conceived in a dystopia.,
3D TVs, Google Glass,  Metaverse.

"the future",
why this isn't next google glass?,
NoFuckinThanks!,
VR chat already has infinitely better tech than Facebook and most people use it to make out as a fox person,
There will be no spoon either 

The metaverse, basically the future volunteer program into “the matrix”,
Ofcourse, the entire idea of their metaverse plan comes from some execs sitting in a meeting discussing "how can we steal apples business plan and make it our own?".,
Bots with titties. This is the way,
Am I the only one reading these comments and watching all of us see the first glimpses of us becoming the boomers?,
AR is useful tech that will be widespread in the years to come. 

VR will always be a niche. "metaverses" (fancy name for an mmo, something that's been around since the 90's) will always be a niche.,
When I’m in my 80s I would want to use the Metaverse to reverse my age, and relive some memories. Just for a short while. Would be very nice.,
Isn’t Magic Leap working on being able to project holograms?,

>	Offers is cancelling nearly 400 transactions of the 8,172 contracts it has with home sellers nationwide.

That’s <5%. They’re all transactions that wouldn’t close until 2H2022. No one should be surprised that with Zillow Offers closing, they’re not going to wait another year to close these deals.,
Zillow paid me 54k above market for my home.  Luckily we moved our close date up to October, because it wasn’t supposed to happen until end of December. Thank God,
Cathie Wood: [sploosh],
If it drops my property value I’m fine with that
Gimme lower property taxes,
They’re releasing their EDP to the owners. Free money and just relist the home. Not a big deal.,
Zillow is going full retard.,
Absolutely terrible plan… they should stick to what they know best .. taking free info repackaging it  and selling it at ridiculous prices to real estate agents,
This headline is sensational, it was only 400 contracts out of over 8000,
What homeowner under these circumstances would actually complain?  They get to keep the earnest money and they have plenty of time to get another buyer.,
Lol they canceled mine they made offer I accepted they walked, made 100 bucks,
Market is correcting itself.. spiked too fast. Won't sustain.,
Sooo no profit in buying or selling? I am a bit confused,
fail,
this was a shitfest like we haven't seen In some time.,
Rates up, RE prices down. '22 to long for a flip. Price haircuts coming.,
Why do grave yards have to take up so much land..Acres and Acres for what?,
It is truly astounding how they managed to lose money in one of the hottest real estate markets ever,
Companies like this are the primary reason for the housing crises making home unaffordable for most as well as driving rent prices to all time highs forcing many into homelessness. I have sympathy for them.,
So short this mfker?,
It brings me joy that a giant corporation failed so hard at something that many people who hardly made it out of highschool can excel at.,
OPs account is very suspicious, no posts for 7 years then suddenly starts posting lots of Zillow, joined WSB a week ago.,
Haha, jokes on you Zillow... my calls are already worthless... literally cannot go tits up from here...,
How TF do they have an out clause? It’s the sellers faults if they do. Left holding a worthless contract from Zillow like a sucker! Fuck that!,
My put gonna print afterall?,
Win for the homebuyer, America won't turn into a place where noone under 40 can afford a house like every other English speaking country..... This time,
A case of ligma,
[deleted],
I thought they had a big brain plan in the works buying these houses at higher values, but just… no,
Zillow rhymes with pillow.,

Single digit percentage correction is not a crash.,
I consider ~20% down from ATH crash. ~10% is correction. 5% or less pullback.,
2% is hardly a crash you fucking pussies. 

Remember when we triggered multiple circuit breakers within 3 hours of each other?,
There are no crashes, only little happy discounts.,
*Market goes up 5%

🌈 🐻: Sell now, it is going to crash.  You'll thank me later.

*Market goes up 33% more for the year.

*Market goes down 2.5%

🌈 🐻: See! I warned you!,
Smart investors bought the dip on Friday.,
SP500 lost about one month's worth of growth, so not exactly a crash.,
Sounds like typical DD,
Yeah, that wasn't a crash,
I do not think I have jinxed it for all the ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)Bulls. But Imma sticks with my calls for Monday. If this is how I lose everything, so be it![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266) (PS I pity the fool that thinks this was a crash),
Literally hella fcking bullish.,
u/david_5_pumpkins,  They're making fun of you.  LOL.,
How the hell was this a crash?. Wth,
I don't buy it.  It doesn't feel like a "crash crash" to me.,
Unfortunately because the way the mkts are structured and the FED put, it's hard to see another long lasting crash.  We will have them but they won't last very long.,
This is trauma selling because at this point in time no one knows anything about the new variant.,
Ah yes ‘crash’,
This is a Wendy's, the Dip n Dots is next door.,
It’s just the newest Black Friday sell. Watch it become a regular thing.,
It wasn't a crash it was a Black Friday Sale. Cyber Monday is your last chance if you missed it!,
I love how 2% is a crash, and 10% is a correction. I see the word crash so fucking much it’s ridiculous. I don’t think it means what you think it means.,
You think this is a crash … Oh sweet summer child,
Interesting article copied below. Fundamental indicators do not look good for a continued bull market :

John Hussman says that indicators of a stock market peak are beyond dot-com bubble levels.  
Hussman wrote an unscheduled, "interim" note to investors because of the occurrence.   
He shared some of the "dozens" of bearish indicators he's looking at.  
It's one thing when a single market indicator — even a few indicators — show weakness. It's difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from small sets of numbers.  
  
It's another thing when "dozens" of indicators start to to deteriorate simultaneously.   
  
That's what started happening in November, according to John Hussman, president of the Hussman Investment Trust. The development prompted Hussman to write an "interim" note to investors — one outside of his normal commentaries.  
  
"Across four decades of work in the financial markets, and over a century of historical data, I've never observed as many historical indications of a market peak occurring simultaneously," Hussman wrote, calling the amount of deteriorating indicators the "mother lode."  
  
"Despite speculative highs in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, our gauges of internals reflect persistent divergence here, with notable deterioration in recent weeks," he continued. "The preponderance of warning flags we observe here are occurring in the context of the most extreme valuations in history, coupled with market internals that are already divergent."  
  
Below are a few indicators among the dozens turning sour. The first, indicated by the red bars, shows instances where the S&P 500 is at highs by a number of measures, but the number of stocks at 52-week highs and lows is significant, and less than three-quarters of stocks are above their 200-day moving averages.  
  
internal divergence with stocks at highs  
Hussman Strategic Advisors  
Next is a simple tally of technical indicators that tend to show up around market peaks. It's currently beyond levels seen during the dot-com bubble.  
  
"The red bars are actually presented on log scale because the tally is beyond anything we've ever observed. The previous record was March 27, 2000, the day after the tech bubble peaked."  
  
Number of peak indicators are at a high  
Hussman Strategic Advisors  
Third is another tally of indicators. It considers bullish sentiment, inflation, rising rates, valuations, waning participation, and divergent leadership.   
  
"Investors might respond with, 'yes, but the ISM is above 50,' or 'yes, but the yield curve isn't inverted,' or 'yes, but we're not in a   
recession  
,' or 'yes, but earnings are estimated to increase,' or with a dozen other 'yes, but' considerations," Hussman said. "The problem is that many of the things that investors associate with market losses emerge only after the market has turned lower. As investors should remember from the 1987 crash, a recession isn't required."  
  
negative indicators tally  
Hussman Strategic Advisors  
While Hussman highlighted these indicators, he said he wasn't necessarily calling this the top, but simply sharing observations. He did say however, that he believes stocks are in a bubble, and that returns over the next 12 years will be dismal.  
  
Hussman's track record — and his views in context  
Hussman has long been warning of overextension and weak negative returns ahead. In recent weeks and months, mainstream views on Wall Street have started to shift his way.  
  
Barry Bannister, chief US equity strategist at Stifel, said earlier this week that stocks are in a bubble and that the Federal Reserve would continue to inflate it through loose monetary policy. But he doesn't see signs of the market peaking right now — instead, he sees the bubble popping around mid-2023.  
  
Bank of America has continued to lower their expectations for S&P 500 returns going forward. Earlier this year, Savita Subramanian, the bank's chief US equity strategist, said that she expects 2% annual returns over the next decade for the index. With valuations continuing to climb, she recently updated that to -0.5% returns, saying the S&P 500 would be at 4,420 in 2031.   
  
In the shorter-term, she said the S&P 500 would drop 20% over the next 12 months. And like Hussman, Subramanian also emphasized consensus in indicators, highlighting that 15 of the 20 valuation measures she watches are historically high.  
  
Both Bannister and Subramanian, who have tended to be among the most bearish strategists on Wall Street recently, believe investors are overestimating earnings performance and economic growth ahead.  
  
Of course, others are more bullish. Morgan Stanley economists just updated their Q4 GDP forecasts to 8.7% from 3%, though their equity strategists are more cautious on index returns going forward.   
  
Strategists at Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are bullish on growth, and accordingly have higher S&P 500 price targets. Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey has a bull-case 2023 price target of 5,300 — about 15% upside from here.  
  
The economic recovery has gained steam in recent weeks. Weekly jobless claims hit their lowest number since 1969 last week, the US economy added more jobs than expected in October, and consumer spending remains intrepid. US consumers spent more in October than they have in any single month in the past.  
  
Yet inflation remains high as businesses work through supply chain issues and high energy prices, though there are signs those troubles are being resolved. Perhaps the biggest hurdle facing stocks in the new year is how they respond to the   
Federal Reserve  
 tapering its asset purchases, which it is beginning this month. The central bank is also expected to start hiking interest rates next year.   
  
For the uninitiated, Hussman has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market has continued to grind mostly higher, he's persisted with his doomsday calls.  
  
But before you dismiss Hussman as a wonky perma-bear, consider his track record, which he broke down in a recent blog post. Here are the arguments he lays out:  
  
He predicted in March 2000 that tech stocks would plunge 83%, then the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost an "improbably precise" 83% during a period from 2000 to 2002.  
Predicted in 2000 that the S&P 500 would likely see negative total returns over the following decade, which it did.  
Predicted in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could lose 40%, then it lost 55% in the subsequent collapse from 2007 to 2009.  
However, Hussman's recent returns have been less-than-stellar. His Strategic Growth Fund is down about 49% since December 2010, though it's risen 1.3% in the past year. Still, the S&P 500 has returned more than 29.5% over the last 12 months.  
  
The amount of bearish evidence being unearthed by Hussman continues to mount. Sure, there may still be returns to be realized in this market cycle, but at what point does the mounting risk of a crash become too unbearable?  
  
That's a question investors will have to answer themselves — and one that Hussman will clearly keep exploring in the interim.,
Certain stocks have already crashed from their all time highs. If there’s no major  armagaedon scenario the entire stock market won’t crash, and if it did it doesn’t really matter where you put the money.,
I see no crash?,
Novavax is shooting up.,
Let's see what Monday brings.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)

As noted by many - so far this is just a dip. And it is soon December. We could see more selling as traders drop their crap to post some losses to offset gains for taxes (yeah, I know, not this group's style). Things are going to get choppy!,
That’s not a crash, that’s a dip,
1-2% down is not a crash. Lol. It will go back up again next week and will remain sideways throughout 2022 2023. Slow growth doesn't mean recession or crash. We are just spoiled since 2008 crash.,
I need to make a WSB index,
S&P 500 is biggest pump and dump in history.,
Oh yeah, I remember that,
In the US it was like 2-3%,
You're cute if you think this is a crash.,
Was up money today 

Nuran wireless,
To be fair, this week was a dip not a crash.,
Markets drop 2% = crash ???,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
Laughs in micron/nu varient,
That's still not a crash,
A mini crash did happen in March 2021 and people seem to forget about it too. It didn’t just happen in 2020…,
my tits are jacked for this hnnnnnnnnnggggg,
Pffff.

Buy the dip :)

Gonna win either way.,
No, no it's a serious crash!!! It's awful!!! Why are you all so dismissive of my eccentric, sensationalist reporting??

-media,
welcome to my life,
This years Black Friday stonks is on massive sell.,
It was 2%!

That's barely a dip in this market.

The S&P500 is still up 24% for the year.

The market is still up for the last 30 days.,
That was only a Black Friday Stonk Sales event.,
A red day isn't a crash, bro,
This wasn’t a correction, this was a Black Friday sale. Monday will be cyber Monday sale then Tuesday all time highs 😂,
That was barely even a correction lmao. He could still be right.,
Who are we pumping bruhduhs? 

I don’t want to get rich I just need the money for medical bills to pay the cardiologist. 😗,
Ha! Caught a Russian spy!(THT logo of Russian TV channel),
Seewweeet stocks on sale! Get'em while they are cheap!,
Man please and there trillions of trillions coming.  JPow magic powder is never ending,
might crash in December, as usual. some opportunities might open up

The doctor in South Africa that discovered the variant has said the symptoms have been different but very mild. Buy the dip.,
Buy the dip. The actually dip though, not the slide. I would imagine there’s going to be a lot more news in the coming days that the market is going to react to and things are going to continue to slide. The market is going to move like $TSLA moved every time Elon tweets.,
Ahh the good old immune system as a service approach...,
Change the red caps to yellow caps… Baltimore rebrand,
Lots of reports saying all cases from new variant had very mild symptoms,
If you aren’t buying the dip do you even stonks,
Why they didn't develop new vaccine against delta variant?,
100 days huh? That should give China ample time to create a new variant 😋,
Stonks not growing as big, new variant, stonks all time high, triple booster shots all in novavax, Moderna and Pfizer. Poor Johnson wished they did for profit.,
Faster! 100 days? Come on. 30.,
100 days this go round but only 2 days on the first one? How's that make sense,
Omicron booster is the next mandatory jab. Who knows how many variants will be discovered by the TVA?,
What baffles me, as a biomed scientist myself is that they jump on the media wave about this variant that we don't know much about

When the Californian or hell even the Britanny variant were identified I didn't see no communications from Moderna or Pfizer about adapting the vaccine

It's quite nasty what they'd do just to have their stonks up based on a variant deemed dangerous over very little information

When the fucking WHO says you're doing too much you need to calm down,
If vaccine is not working, you need booster. If booster not working you need  new variant, to produce new vaccine...simple. People are tired of being pushed for new shots, this eint gonna work anymore. Only therapeutic sollution is now reality. SRNE is doing great progress, very very soon will be out with blockbusters ABIVERTINIB and nasal drops. I am all in - will run like Moderna last year! Stay well and a lot of health!,
Let’s keep “tweaking” these vaccines. Zombie apocalypse 2022…,
There is only one way out of this endemic and that's INOVIO DNA INO-4800/4802 using CELLECTRA Delivery Device,
Actual negative feedback loop. High antibody resistance virus = Pharma companies trying to maxvax = high initial resistance = mutations = high antibody resistance. I don’t think any sane person would take a vaccine developed in 100 days,
Will they still be able to engineer the blood clots with this one?,
People stopped caring about taking vaccines unfortunately. So, if omicron becomes the dominant variant and evades immune responses, herd immunity will be significantly weakened, and this could prolong the disastrous economic toll we haven’t seen since the first wave in the winter of 2020.,

**0:36:** Maz Kanata’s Voice: ‘The call, it calls to you’

**0:36:** …and his hand tilts upward to reveal a WSB logo ring. He realizes he was always options-sensitive, just unaware of his powers. He force-conjures up some sunglasses, converts his broom to a green candlestick. He is now ready to trade his first contract but still avoiding the beckon of ornamental gourd futures, since it's a pathway some consider to be unnatural

**0:37:** Leia’s voice: ‘Always’

Well, I sold a $340 call for Sept 2022, so really hopping this would stay flat for the next year or so lmao.,

As far as I’m concerned, idgaf about all that. Just going to keep buying and losing.,
GTFO!  FJB!,
They'll Find a Way,
I think they're already raising prices to cover the  losses, so the new rules won't affect the bottom line much.,
When counties have to start forming unions to keep their wages fair.,
I think it’s wrong. Each nation should be sovereign and free to set their own taxes. 

Some countries have oil and other natural resources yet we don’t try to distribute it. 

Smaller countries have no natrual resouces and use finance as their industry 
 
What do I think is  better is if each nation taxes the wealth earned in that country,
They pass that shit onto the consumer.,
It's the only way to tax them effectively.,
In my mind, I see this tax being passed along to the customer. Just like every other corporate business expense. Corporations won't pay this. Consumers will through higher prices. Maybe that is too simple and incorrect. If someone else has a rebuttal, please share.,
My f-ed up conclusion is basically that when corps incur additional expenses the execs there only have one move that is in the best interest of investors, whom they are legally beholden to, which is to raise prices for ape and pre-apes. earnings projections are poll numbers and we lose. Oly way win is get massofapes to believ IN SUMTIN!!!!,
To be fair, any US company isn’t going to see much of a change. Their overseas profits are already taxed at a minimum rate, and it was 16% last year overall,
Im not paying taxes to the fucking UN, you dont do shit for me I wont give shit to you. Or who exactly would be getting the revenue?,
While your worried about profits this is the first stop on the way to a one world authoritarian government where the government gets their "share" and decides what you should earn.,
It will ultimately increase profits.  Companies will add the commensurate amount to the product price and a percentage more to compensate for any unforeseen expenses.  Price of the stock is a function of the market, not the company.,
wtf well expect a 15% loss on price then if markets are rational i got an idea how about abolition of income tax as inhuman gov gets rev from tariffs luxury tax sale tax and nationalizing banks credtcard processers and all debt sectors,
Prices of their products and services will increase to offset 15% tax hike. This isn’t rocket science.,
Global Tax = Global Government. It's already here,
Doesn’t matter. Write a dd if you have something to say.,
Fuck their earning, they pay more in taxes mean less global debt, means a strong world,
With the tax, they’ll probably be able to bring cash back into the US which could be an indirect benefit,

One of my friends got a bunch of Moderna stock when he used to work there but right before Covid hit he solid it all and bought a shitty motorcycle. We should get him in there. Would be millionaire if he didn’t,

I was confused at first. I thought this post meant Evergrande had finally blown up and that I missed it. But it's *just* covid.,
Gotta double down on those vaccine stocks,
Every crash is a covid crash. Nevermind the manipulation.,

Today is proof that WSB is less fucking retarded than actual Wallstreet. 

Possibility of a new variant and its a huge sell off? Bullshit- its market manipulation.,
WHAT China has to do with today's market?? 

someone enlighten me,
Come Monday we're back in business. The cabal needed to drop yields so we can continue on this drunken debt path,

I haven't looked at the market today.

covid cycle is the new china trade war cycle... again.,
thanks for the black friday sale fuckers, see you at the MOASS™,
The boosters made me feel like shit,
Wouldn’t it ironic if the Asians now starting beating up on old black people?,
The more it dip, the more I buy,
context?,
Lol,
Everyone get your intraday calls on!  The new variant is not more dangerous, Delta is still the most threatening.  The whole thing is  a storm in a teacup and now that news is spreading.  They've red-listed these countries because they don't want to allow yet another variant in whilst Delta is still floating about.  The new African Omicron or whatever it's called has so far had 0 deaths.  This news will come out over the weekend and come Monday things will go up again.  

Although, as always happens.  The crash takes 5 minutes but it takes 5 months to get back to where it was.,
The CCP seems to like blaming other countries for its own blunders... *cough* covid *cough*,

Buy the dip,
LMAO. I'm glad I"m not the only one who sees the absurdity in a bunch of rich countries ganging up on a poorer country bc it had the nerve to catch a virus that China started. A virus which is all over the world rn. If they rely on tourism or foreign business this could hurt them a lot.,
\-69696969696969696969696969 social credits,
I actually caused it by closing my puts for a loss on Monday,
Fuck the Chinese Communist Party 🔥!!!,
Yeah I’m kind of side eye Chloe to anyone blaming corona.,
Fuck china,
Y'all rtards really invest wrong if you lost heavily today. This sub has gone to complete shit since the ridiculous GameStop controversy.,
And now we wait for the Chinese bots…,
China is a cancer,
I swear they say the same shit every time "New variant that spreads 1000% better and mostly evades vaccines" they have only been right once and that was for Delta and them being right about that doesn't mean much when they say the same thing EVERY TIME,
fuck CCP,
[removed],
Damn Chinese virus,
F#@!!@##!@#!@  i han't looked at my stocks all day,...  just did...   need to go cry..,
I’ve been away from the news for about a week and just now got back on Reddit - what I miss?  Africa create something that competes with something made in China or something?,
LOL, WSB just ain’t what it used to be.,
Love how moderna literally back to where it was less than a month ago after shaving 40%
My only regret was not buying more calls when they were dirt cheap,
It's crazy how stupid y'all are in blaming China for everything bad when you can realize China using other countries for scape goats is just their own ploy. 

But when you do it to US/ China it makes logical sense to you? Y'all are the biggest victims of the red scare and decades of western propaganda.,
The Wuhan wheezer.,
china evergrande debt cover up,
Fuck China,
Hahahaha, too funny,
Today was my best trading day since I restarted about 6 months ago. +£20k ($27k) and it could be way more when the market reopens. 😎,
Gyna did blame black people for covid, but no one wants to talk about it ☕🐸,
I feel like hf's gotten more stupid than ever, my only speculate is that its a setup to ment look like that
Their just making up "new" variants when they feel like, article says in israel that African variant was found, common........ it was found months ago and israel shape is better then ever, i would expect sec to be smarter about what he publish, bunch of clowns.,
this what China would have been saying all along,
Perfect meme,
The posting is  like me explaining where is China and I say it is in Africa.,
They skipped Xi lol,
They probably just needed an excuse to sell. Cause i don't see why the whole world would crash over a new covid strain. When they didn't care about any of them except the first when it hit Europe.,
Didn’t they already prove Covid was around before Covid started?  Cases were detected the gulf areas before being detected in China. Still could have started there but who knows.,
Wow CIA infiltrating WSB. I was here,
What does China have to do with anything,
No gaslighting to see here… 👀,

Actually Biontech has four mid-stage clinical trial programs for cancer treatments, including one for colorectal cancer (https://www.deraktionaer.de/artikel/aktien/biontech-mit-starken-zahlen-aktie-im-plus-20240518.html). Colorectal cancer is a very huge health problem. My mother died because of colorectal cancer, my father was very short before because of this cancer. But my father was very lucky to come over it. I think i read somewhere else, they have additional to the four also 6 preclinical cancer-projects in the pipeline.,
The handcrafted logo convinced me.

holy shit, its only 12% of your portfolio... 1.75 mil in RH should be illegal,
Don't worry, worst case if you lose the 240K, you'll be licking your wife's BF but*hole when he is doing your wife.,
Divorce her and get a new one who supports ur autism,
I'm here with 33 average. 

Buy and forget. I have 200k at 33 lol.,
Delete this post or she can use it as cause for divorce,
Make that ex wife, and boyfriend,
Her bf YOLO’d on MRNA,
I have 15,000 shares, been making $6-10,000 a month just selling covered calls.

Alex told you this wasn’t going to be a quick flip.,
Pltr is stable coin. Will be $21 in 2050,
One of us, one of us. Palantards united,
You should listen to your wife. Her boyfriend work at WB.,
11.69% is not a YOLO u pussy.,
You have shares this ain’t a yolo,
Should’ve listened to your wife, now I’ll be her boyfriend,
I thought WSB was a FD buying sub?,
If your wife said not to buy this stock, you should definitely buy the stock. IN,
Ignore all the background noise and hold. Palantir is a solid company...,
It’s a 5-10 year hold. Relax, listen to some music, take a drive through some bendy roads, bang your wife the way her boyfriend does and enjoy life,
Puts on your marriage.,
Right there with you, 12k shares !!! Will double up if it goes below $20,
Gonna lose it all,
Looks like your wife will be joining me this Christmas. Tell her to wear that purple fit I bought her last Easter.,
why didn't you listen to your wife's boyfriend?,
I bought call options 24 strike exp dec17 🙃,
Already lost his wife.,
Etrade or almost anywhere else for that kind of money,
Diversity 99% is YOLO, you definitely NOT,
My 470 calls are with you,
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2pexn/thanks_for_the_insurance_money,
Good news you can average down for couple of more weeks!,
I thought the ideal was to buy pltr under $20...it's giving so many chances and has always ripped from below $20. Cost average $24 tho?, Hmm,
great average palantard.,
Your wife is very right :p,
Soon to be ex-wife,
Did your wife tell you which stock to buy? She seems to be a prophet,
Tell your wife you want a divorce.,
What is a wife and why are you listening to a power outside of yourself? Oh wait, you are…niiiiceeee ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Didn’t the ceo say he was going to keep diluting ?,
Lol 😂 you’re fucked, but at least you’re in commons 👍🏽,
I think he ment ex wife after this play😂,
Although you may be down PLTR, long term you’ll do alright.,
You’re an animal,
Our wife*,
This sub has gotten soft buying shares.. 

it should be 240k in FD's expiring next week,
6x $13c sept 2022 leap contracts here. Down slightly at the moment. If exercised my average cost is $24ish

Not worried in the slightest. Was up big before that ER… I give it another month or two to be back at $28,
At 21 it's a steal....hahaha,
At $21 its a good buy - Average down and get out !,
If the dividend discount and traditional valuation metrics kick in due to inflation you are holding a $1.50 stock,
Dude hold few months till it hits $29-30 and redo it again. $80-90k win easy!,
She’s not wrong tho,
Imagine buying at $35…,
I have 600. I’m just a small fry,
You should have listened to her,
What platform is this?,
Pltr so boring, you’ll be up or down 1000 on your position in an year 😴,
Down already? Clearly a palantard. 22$ cost average,
I would sell off half the position at this point and lock in some of those profits. You’ll make lots of money off the remaining shares in the upcoming years.,
tbh that could be a good move.,
It will bounce back no doubt, this is a long term hold stock,
hmm, i'm already smell the divorce paper,
U be millionaire in 5 years retard,
Your doing great, keep up the great job!!!!        

Sincerely 

Joe Biden,
Should have bought options, that way you technically wouldn’t be buying stock,
I dont know why you idiots keep buying stocks that only go down.,
Never listen to your wife! That’s financial advice!!,
It's a good long term hold. Lookup Peter Thiel, anything he's done has turned to gold one way or another.,
How do people have so much money,
Honestly, their share dilution to employees has me bearish on the play :/

They won’t stop handing out shares like gang haters,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Get a new wife,
See that to 250k,
RemindMe! 6 months,
Whenever my wife comments on my trading I just refer her to the “know your fucking place, trash” meme.,
She will love dump and pump soon!,
Divorce her and hold this for $50 at least😛,
I’ve been hodlin’ PLTR for a while now. It’s a  stunk not a stonk.,
Hi, nice to meet you. I’m your wife’s boyfriend!,
Tell her ill be over around noon to split her open.,
I own PLTR but I would not use a spec play as 10% of my portfolio
PLTR is going to bounce back,look again in a year.
Only stocks I trust for large plays are shit like Apple,NVDA,Goog
Ill throw 50 ,100G grand at apple and not worry,
Your wife is right, should not invest in dog shit.,
You mean our wife,
I’m short. Good luck. $9 stock.,

I loved that we are all so over levered 2% is a crash,
"It's an excellent time to buy."
He's not wrong,
The dude saying it’s an excellent time to buy is me IRL whenever money hits my account.,
what was the date on this?,
Fear and greed? Would that be F.A.G.?,
LFG,
These guys are probably dead now, making them *wrong.*,
They're all right. Except I've been buying the dip all year....,
Our country is regressing,
That's pretty Chad of these guys. They didn't have the benefit of a couple extra decades worth of observation of dips being bought that we do, and they had the right idea.,
All those guys are dead aren't they?,
When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping!,
Ah the comments. MFs think we are in a state of excess fear when SPY dropped 2%, and EV bubble is still pretty much bubble. 

All I see is greed greed greed when people scream of a buying opportunity on - 1-2% moves or draw parallels with Black Monday. Before you reference it, find some decency to at least read first paragraph in wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987). Markets worldwide dropped anywhere between 20% to 40% in a single day! 

If that to happen some near future, majority of you here would be margin called, the big part of the rest will be shitting pants, and only some few megachads will be buying *the* dip,
Ohhhh, so that’s why they suddenly rolled out the Moronic variant propaganda. I get it now.,
[removed],
So buy more with my monopoly dollars?,
grandpa knows best,
Monday is going to be fun!,
Which year was this?,
But my grandpa wasn't rich,
Lol yeah 2% isn’t a dip not at all.,
Circuit Breakers this week?  Let's hope so!,

I swear one day I will read your post and understand it,
The numbers and lines Mason, what do they mean?!,
[deleted],
>Bullish Targets: 481/60 - 488.27 - 496.41 - 503.71

i think you meant 481.6 :),
If SPY reached below 100 SMA, it would be similar to March 2020.

On Jan 25, 2021 market was down 3.5%.

On Nov 26, market was down 2.5%, it is the 2nd big decline on this year.,
I SPY a berry bloody Monday open,
The nightman cometh.,

Underrated post.,
Lagarde is now ECB president. Wow !,
I'm gonna pull a prediction out of me ass.
I expect it to pump up to around 463-464, hold for a bit and then shit back down to 457-456 after more news comes out.
They're already indicating that omicron will be a defining catalyst. The bulls will come out in force to buy the dip and then reality will set in.,
Oh my god nerd. I didn’t join this sub for a math lesson. Just tell me how many 3 Dec way OTM calls I need to buy?,
And all this can change in a matter of seconds so yeah,
!reminder 13 hours,
Why’d you use 65 mins? seems like such an odd  choice why not just use an hour - just out of interest,
A good way to view this is that news will be the catalyst and this will pretty well predict the outcome.

As always, your TA gets me rock hard.,

Chinese NVDA hahahahahahahaha.

Hahahahahahahahahahaha.

First chip will probably be based on stolen VHDL from ARM MALI or something. Rebranded as "Golden Dragon Video Core.,
More innovative ways for investors to get scammed!,
bagholders incoming,
sweet they can get de-listed too!,
The party approves this message comrade! + 420 social credit score. Report to your nearest CCP office for an extra ration of rice and more Evergrande bonds!,
Ide rather work for citadel than buy another China soon to be FUD story. So over China BS at this point. Go away, delist them all fuck it,
Baba and wish holders are getting ptsd,
This sounds like the bagholders saying wish is the next amazon.,
SoTheyCanWatchYouPlay,
Jokes on you, nvidia already Chinese. Gogo daddy Jensen,
Oh man. I wonder how much of this is stolen NV/AMD tech 😂😂,
Personal experience. A bag holder! 

Except few big names like NIO, Baba, etc., the rest of Chinese stocks are just out there to get huge fund flow from the USA while their company maybe valued at $1M.,
Its all stolen IP with probably espionage backdoors built in,
Yeah..... I'm sure people and governments will be fawning all over this bleeding edge technology that sends all your information on it to China...,
Every time someone posts 'Chinese' version of a successful company/high cap, it just means it's the 10 cent version,
👎🏽,
Nah, I prefer to stay away from China.  God knows the CEO will disappear for a month after liking a picture of Winnie the Pooh, and the last thing we'll see is someone reading their apology letter.  Meanwhile my shares lose 50-80% of their value and my wife leaves me for the guy who invested in WISH.,
Chinese gifts keeps on giving!,
Chinese? Psssshhhhh,
No,
Nope. Thank you.,
RIP in peace my social credits.,
You just know this will be featured on $Wish.com,
I believe you can buy these on wish lol,
Whats the ticker,
Lol,
Doesn’t have nearly the respectable ai language compared to leather jacket man. Not even close to a competitor to Nvda or Amd . It’s taken those companies 15 years to be where they are at.,
I am primed to buy puts, Chinese stocks and WISH are the only reasons my portfolio is green,
China rips off every company that goes for cheaper labor.  Clearly a bad sign for any Chinese company.,
Funny. I remembered when Nvidia fucked up with Microsoft. They got the shaft and their FX series were a giant paper weight. I bought the thing and I moved to the red team. I didn't look back until the 1080Ti was released.

Now some Chinese punk wants to enter the market and somehow hope he could bully his way with Microsoft, Google and Apple?

I could see them working on CPU if they bank on the mobile market but GPU is not something they could enter without serious support from the OS companies themselves.,
Until I see that they have an architecture ready for tape out on an advance TSMC node, this is all bullshit.,
Wasn't there already Chinese nvidia? I'm sure there's AMD as well due to an agreement with them a while ago.  Although,  supposedly,  the tech they got was years behind where it is now.,
TAKE MY MONEY!!!,
Moore traps.,

I just bought a 12€ mouse from logitech so the stonks should go up on monday,
Dude that’s a lot of adderall. Idk why you’re drinking beer when on that much adderall cus you won’t feel shit from the beer.

And idk why you wrote all this shit because I’m not gonna read that shit. Write a tldr with some 🚀🚀 emojis and I’ll buy some calls on Monday.,
NOPE. Already got burnt from $CRSR,
Idk man, I feel like the peripheral upgrade cycle is complete and it’s going to stagnate for years now.,
While I think Logitech and Corsair are both solid buys, how often are people really replacing their peripherals? I've had the same keyboard and mouse for over 5 years. Headset too.,
JUST EJACULATED OVER MY LOGITECH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE READING THIS HARD HITTING DD,
Bulk order the webcams and cause epic supply shortage? Like first covid wave. I’m in.,
I scrolled completely past you analysis to the comments, but I know how the buy button works.,
ILL FINISH THIS WHEN I GET HOME (sorry they are closing starbcusk i have to bail, I LOVE UOPXOXO)

Hi, i wanna critique ur shit. Maybe all i say will be shit too, or maybe something may be valid for hedge.  
  
1 - critique of your intro part:  
you are way too much into this company. soo much, in fact, it's a bit scary.  
remember that to others (like me) logitech my be a cheap knock-off company, and their brand doesn't mean nearly as much. they are not a brand premium stock to me, they are not apple. they are more aquim to wallmart brand (which is good, but different).  
consider me a skeptic - as a investor, i'm only paying for the cash flow and assets of the company, not for the past / goodwill or anything else.  
  
. one: what secular trend? please elaborate  
. two: sustaining yoy growth since when? above GDP growth? "strong cash flow" strong in comparison to who? we need something to compare to understand why is it stronger then the other case. also strong FCF, like, really? shouldn't they cash flow suffer from increase in working capital, given that logistics will cuck them hard between receiveing parts, paying suppliers, shipping and receiving payment? (not only that, but... ain't inflation fucking their receivables?)  
. three: two year basis, ok, can you give me a 10 year basis please yoy given that the products you cited are from 2011? it's natural do have a 82% income increase if you weren't selling shit in 2019, soo it's too hard to understand this without reference  
. four: once again, please keep any personality outta your analysis - i love me some panda express but wouldn't buy meituan for shit because the company is shit, that you like them doesn't really matter in terms of foward stock price movement  
  
2- earnings:  
. one: 60% increase in marketing is weird but ok, how much % of total expenditure is marketing? did they ever did this in the past? also, the 30% increase in RD is because they are not capitalizing RD expenditure, or is it really like they are forcing higher expenditure to deffer taxes? any changes in taxes % from this move?  
. two: if the company affirmed a +5/-5 % change in revenue but had +82% revenue up in two years, what kind of monkey business guidance is this shit?  
. three: ok, don't care, dividends fell short but close enough  
. four: same, don't really care, their revenues seem higher but close enough  
. five: what is their metric for adjusted operating income? seems like some HEALTHY margins there pal, you shoulda have focused more on this <3 me love me sum margins  
. six: did you watched the transcripts of the CEO quarter results updates? i hope you like this guy, the CEO kinda matters in being creative to tackle problems  
  
3- Next earnings date:  
.one: ok  
.two: welp, this kinda sucks. how are we supposed to know when the stock is gonna be ex-dividend? when does it generally pays?  
  
4: q2 sales:  
.one: ok  
.two: is it reverting to the average? what the hell happened for income to decline like that, seasonality, covid? how did it changed from the last 10 years % wise?  
.three: what the hell are they considering is their non-gaap stuff? that 4% is fucking huge, i want my 4% goddamnit  
.four: yada yada IM THE CEO TRUST ME SHIT IS GOOOODD BOI  
.five: once again: is is reverting to the average or did they just suddenly became the best fucking dividend paying company outta the blue? and why is it not reflected on stock price soo? kinda weird that this shit suddenly started paying 30 years bond-like coupom, ain't it  
.six: that's really nice, do they keep their cash in TIPS or something that can be protected? do they have any M&A in mind?  
.seven:ok cash flow from operations is growing, but, same as on the start of this text, why? can you please post a cash conversion cycle shit soo i can know that they are not just getting frisky?  
.eight: 52 months? 4.33 years? what a weird metric, can you please explain why it is adjusted like this to this specific time-frame?  
  
5: dividend:  
.one: ok  
.two: i got it  
.three: yeah? what are it's leverage ratios? can you please post a numerical du-point to justify saying this? remember, just saying it without something to compare too it's not convincing to a skeptical  
  
6: the dip  
.one: supply chain issues where not a thing in november 2020... why did it DIPPED before? it's down harder YTD, i get it, but before YTD, in 12m it's dipping too.... why?? weird, didn't they had an amazing quarantine year because of camgirls yada yada?  
.two: GREAT analysis, this is a bulletproof point based that you compare a 10 year to a current number. ok, but why you think that is?  
.three: the stock also seems to have substantially increased it's volatility since 2019... why? it was a calm stock then it got on a triangle road by the looks of things, fuck critiques, this can't be just marketing overxpending unless their marketing budget ate more then 50% of the whole cost of operations  
  
7: The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:  
.one: shit i don't know how to value this, no idea what this means to LOGI in specific, can you elaborate? if there's a correlation, can you please present a correl analysis?  
.two: ok, same as before. i'm not cathie woods, i'm a sucker stock buyer, how could i specifically value this please? help, me dumb, me don't know what it means - is it money? when is it money then? is it eatable?  
.three: ok, update it  
.four: 90% accuracy is such a weird fucking metrics... why? a missile with 90% accuracy shot near a hospital may be as fucking dangerous as if it was a 68% accurate shot far from it  
.five: ok, the teams will get back shortly, also, you got selected on a list to receive it  
.six: ok update it  
  
8: Is Logitech a bargain right now?  
.one: ok, thats just stating facts  
.two: ok, i don't know who this bloomberg guy is, i don't care - if his picks were half as good as they look, he wouldn't be telling them on TV, he woulda be telling them on his fucking hedge fund 13f  
.three: the delta variant HURTED LOGI, altough the original covid helped it? dafuq? HOW!? what do this guy means?  
.four: what?  
.five: TRACKBALLS? videogaming is going to be a "THING OF THE FUTURE" are this motherfucker speaking from the 1990's???? the industry exists for half a fucking century buy now, what future is he speaking off???  
.six: very cheap compared to itself, sure, but compared to other gaming peripherals companies how does it currently fair? once again, comparing a stock dividend to a bond dividend IS NOT A GOOD THING my guy, i would buy corporate bonds if i wanted corporate bonds yields, can they explain whats the goal here?  
.seven: CEO saying shit is good, whatever, every CEO says soo  
.eight: most share buybacks programs are authorized by board meanings a couple of years before they happen... how is the voting rights in this stock? how pulverized is the board of directors and company ownership in general? this may seem picky, but i wonder really who controlls this shit if i'm going to be a minority buyer in it, makes sense doesn't it,
Just read the part about the adderrall. 

Will assume the rest is quality DD and YOLO into $LOGI.,
Nice writeup, OP.

**other potential short term catalysts:**

* buzzwords/meme potential: their chairperson of the board recently referred to the "omniverse" as a huge opportunity 

* Dec 1: presentation at Credit Suisse annual technology conference 

*disclosure:* bag holder at $90 average,
Lots of words but why not CRSR?

Also would a wave 5 of covid make people buy more microphones and webcams? This is very much a covid play with inflated sales. LOGI is mostly an office supply company.,
Lots and lots of words,
All I read was “I want something like CRSR with less opportunity.”,
I like how when Logitech finally comes down to earth, someone out there is like “yeah that’s undervalued.” Current market sentiment is fun.,
If you need more 3 pages to describe your thesis instead of 3 sentences there is something wrong. Volume does not equal brilliance. $LOGI will do well just because of the new variant will force corporations that were on the fence about tele-work to bite the bullet and spend on the equipment which likely they won't use much. Bullish for the next few weeks/months.,
This is only part 1?!,
Wouldn’t it’s current P/E ratio indicate it’s slightly overvalued?,
my thoughts: logi could be a good value play, but i wouldn't expect it to go up much for a while. they're estimating flat growth for 2022, so it could be a year or more before it does anything. that's why it's down so much. price became inflated when it was growing rapidly, so it deflated back to it's normal valuation multiples.,
Long term? I'm out,
I read about 1/8 of this....my takeaway $LOGI calls on Monday. 

Please don't write a part 2, I can only get so wet.,
3 words: I’m buying calls,
and i need a new mouse

bullish af,
The week I sells calls against my horrendous put assignment and now it will moon. Perfect,
This DD made me look back at my Logitech Chart. And it's hitting a weekly support line I had from its run up years ago. My thinking at the time was that the price was too high for me and wanted to wait for it to come down. I still like the stock and company, might be time to start buying. With a low end of $50 and a high hopes of $120+,
https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-pavilion-gaming-desktop-tg01-2170m-pc-3v2z3av-1?jumpid=ma_hp-gaming_product-tile_desktops_5_3v2z3av-1_hp-pavilion-gaming-d,
you maroon 😂 gonna be right back to a 2 week impromptu tolerance break in 2 weeks 
LOGI moonshot dd golden,
9: What makes Logitech a good buy?:  
.one: ok, stating facts  
.two: ok, stating facts  
.three: webcams?? aren't laptop manufactures the actual demand owners of webcams per se, or are not laptop webcams considered webcams in the research? weird data  
.four: ok, but the last reported didn't knew about the pandemic  
.five: buddy, i NEVER invest in long term if you can't tell me the exact (even if wrong) year that that LONGTERM will realize itself in... remember the addage, in the longest of terms we are all DEAD, soo can you please tell me when this long term is based on or do you just extrapolated trends as the CEO and said your only strategy is to grow more because you have grown more in the past??? that's a 7 yo analysis of growth spur when he is 25yo, remember that LOGI IS NOT a new company  
  
10: Gaining market share:  
.one: ok  
.two: ok  
.three: ok, soo old products are driving sales... cool... then WHY THE FUCK is R&D soo high right now? what is the rock cooking, can someone please tell that CEO to tell us if his team of R&D is the same and have some kind of success track behind it at least soo i know WHO DAFUQZ is costing me soo much more yoy???  
  
11: Demand is high for hybrid solutions:  
.one: ok, jesus i can't believe im still reading this  
.two: are their products accessible to old people? it feels like he is focusing a lot on webcam for business and casual business... soo can Rodger, 61, sales executive set up a LOGITECH TM brand webcam without too much hassle? this matters  
.three: darell, the fucking ocean is HUGE and its argument for fishing it all is AS USEFULL AS YOUR FUCKING COMPARISON in business... can you please elaborate???  
  
12: Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:  
.one: ok  
.two: ok... then how come delta variant is pegging the company stock compared to market?  
.three: ok... once again, i get it, but will logitech occupy this space instead of cheaper chinese knockoffs? are they sure?  
.four: mate, FUCK YOUR FEELINGS AND OPINIONS ON THEIR PRODUCTS PLEASE, i'm here to make money by buying the stock, not the nostalgia you feel. WILL YOU PAY ME HIGHER FOR THE STOCK ON THE FUTURE COCKSUCKER? that's what matters  
.five: how much this specific C920 product makes up of their current webcam business? does it have competitors? please talk about the product, other then saying it's a top pick. fucking... everything can be a top pick and be replaced on a whimce, what differential it provides, why is it THE PREFERRED as you say? (lmao sorry im sounding angry by now)  
.six: third party can go fuck itself  
.seven: OK, this is nice... 28%, i like this number. is it up, is it down? on a historical basis  
.eight: ok cool, video gaming market, sure... quick question: can logitech explore it's current position in the videogaming market for more money? are their demand in these products elastic enough to eat inflation? are their pricing power decent enough?  
.nine: third party CAN. GO. FUCK. ITSELF.  
.ten: ok, got it  
.eleven: once again: growth drivers are just a random word unless you puy some estimatives for WHEN it will happen on it, even if you have to say pasts results may not be representative of future performance yada yada  
.twelve: ok, thanks  
  
13: Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:  
one: ok, but is it more undervalued then normal or is it discounted like everyone else?  
  
...  
(to be finished, you can read the above BECAUSE I READ YOUR SHIT too),
I didn't even read all of that but I'm here for it.,
I'm not convinced. Their stream services business is taking a pummelling this week for shady business practices and their competitive edge in mice and keyboards has been eroded because they've reached the practicable limit of response times while weight reduction is well past the point of diminishing returns. Webcam and streaming peripheral competition is steep and they don't have competitive advantages there.

I use a logitech keyboard and mouse, both top end, but it's hard to see how their position improves from here. I think they were the leader and are now just one of the pack.,
I just dig endless holes on Minecraft when I take adderall. 

i see you kinda do the same thing on here.,
“Cam girl friend” Link? Stopped reading after that,
I bought a new Logitech wireless mouse last year too replace the most I had for about 7 years. I can't believe I waited so long. It rocks and is 100x more comfortable to use.,
You mean I should sell my CRSR bags to buy LOGI ? NO THANKS,
Had to replace my keyboard and mouse on Friday from Logitech. Mouse double clicking and several key aps broke off at the stem. They don't sell replacements and I don't feel like soldering their board. 2 year warranty and it lasted 2 years and 5 months. Cusyomer service of course told me it was out of warranty if I asked them for suggestions for keycap replacements for their boards after telling me they don't sell replacements keycaps. Ordered new stuff. Never buying Logitech again. 1 keyboard or mouse, sure. Both failing right after warranty. I'm out. Puts if anything.,
MX Master worth it,
Nope. The big sales jumps from last two years for Corona has pumped it up. It will only go down.,
>Puts on my hydration

My fucking sides 😂,
When I got addicted to grand theft auto online, I bought everything Logitech even the g910 fancy mechanical keyboard. 

That’s why I bought TTWO (the only one of my investments in the green right now) when it was low because as soon as GTA 6 comes out, that will be fun to watch,
undervalued? sounds like the beginning of a clown meme,

This was funny as hell good job and upvote cuz Shakira Shakira,
Oh fuck, now that had a punchline!,
I’d happily let that version of omicron in me….

Also this is hilarious.,
As someone currently in Africa.

Can confirm.,
Pfizer: How can we break into the African market?,
can i borrow your vuvuzela?,
shakira makes my dick hard,
All the 🌈 bears calibrating,
OP this is hilarious. Good job autist.,
One of you jerkoffs made that?,
This is worth the crash imo at least it’s funny. 



Honestly though I feel like Africa doesn’t really play as much in the global economy. Am I wrong? Genuinely curious.,

Major indexes definitely got a red card today,
😂😂😂,
Up UP,
Wait so is Shakira the omicon variant?,
That Omicron variant lookin fine tho,
Bring it.  I’ll buy the dip harder than I did in 2020. People are dumb if they think it’s going to stay down.,
Those hips though 👀,
I bless the rains down in Africa![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968),
Damnit, if only we could have foreseen how us throwing millions of expired vaccines in the trash and giving people their 3rd and 4th boosters while we gave Africa nothing could backfire on us.,
Oh come on now this new varient is "moronic" sorry I meant omicron...,
This song was too funny to me when I was a kid.,
Awesome video OP,
this lit.,
Well this is the future so covid has 20 different mutations and is basically super aids now. You know, here in the future, were we are.,
Waka waka ehhhh ehhhh, portfolio drops 10 percent,
this is always how I thought of the market when I was asked to visualize it as football!,
This is a great song,
The “my portfolio” guy 😂😂😂😂,
I love it,
And just like delta, it will be gone. Buy the dips.,
WSB has some of the best comedians and content. You keep my spirits up whilst my PF shits itself  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Pray for COVID Omarion variant,
Unlike that charity aid concert in the 1980s this time Africa knows its Christmas time. They've got their very own variant as a present.,
Wahooooo,
The irony that Africa would have a fricken variant. (Get it),
This is insensitive man… it’s a matter of life and death…
It’s not always about money,

Holy shit. Takes brass balls to hold for a 2,400% gain. 

My limp paper hands would have sold at 200%.,
Good job, you fucking asshole.,
KARMA farming is really a pain in the ass.

Congrat you reatard.,
I bought at the top on Friday at $350 lol.,
Mondays gonna be rough if they discover the vaccine doesn’t do shit for omincron,
When did you get these?,
Oh how much karma do you need,
Damn you're dumb. You should have bought all options. Loser. (Cries).,
Jw with such big gains on options can you sell before expiration date?

 But some nice tindies there, hope it stays and you don't become full retard on Monday.,
Nice,
Jelz AF right now.,
I hate you

This is the way,
How come I have never made a bagger and every one else has. Was poor yesterday, am poorer today.,

The Greek you weren’t expecting,
$530 call omg,
Omicron Persei 8?

https://morbotron.com/img/S07E11/558057.jpg,
your 481 call is up $34, go and buy yourself some Wendy’s son,
At least it didn’t bring you down under $25,000 and marked you as a pattern day trader..... yet....,
Omicron sounds like a Transformer from back in the day.,
Free money… for whoever sold you these dumbass strikes,
Some time, somewhere, op thought spy 530’s were a smart choice,
When you realize omicron is actually an anagram for MORONIC. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Dude market is going to be super green by Tuesday.,
You’re good man, you have until January/February don’t freak out…. Yet,
They say diversify your portfolio 🤔,
No risk management,
$REKT pretty bad,
Odd timing isn't it?,
When all in becomes all out,
LOL 200 contracts for 515c, i love it.

i think you’re probably fine bro. today twitter has been spreading news of the recent findings by south african scientists that basically say it’s nbd.

god speed.,
you're nuts,
Thanks. My asshole is pretty taut compared to this.,
I’m going all in on these exact ones next week.,
If I were you, I'd move closer ITM and give your calls a bit more time.

Then, do poor man's covered call. I was unhedged during the gap down (my fault) but I openes up covered calls right away at open.

We headed lower but I was neutral thanks to the covered calls.

I also used the credit from there to open up put debit spreads just in case we head lower.

You'll be fine. Just be smarter next time. Learn how to defend ur positions,
those are long calls, youll be fine , eventually,
lol you got fucked by your gambling addiction. get smart man.,
$SPY all variant cases from SA were from discovered after a flight which means these people had no symptoms if they got on flights ....

.. Sounds like a highly transmissible but no severe symptoms ..... which will finally end the virus if that's the case 

BUY CALLS,
Wasn’t that a Star Trek episode title?,
i finally realized that I over analyzed the market. candle sticks, waning moons, triple shoulders….all horse shit. new trading is: new covid variant, economy crashing, inflation, then on a random tuesday +14%. after the pump, about a month of bleeding with a final “big” dump aka cause panic selling where these mother fuckers buy it all up and make small fortunes over night. All one big bullshit scam,
Is that the title of your sex tape?,
Not a single put to hedge ? thank you for playing. 😂,
I think alot of people are about to get fucked by it.,
Guys, they gotta lock it down again before the 22 elections so they can do mail-in ballots again... This was inevitable.,
We had delta, just missing gamma, theta, and rho.,
I rather have these than mine.

470 SPY calls expiring in 2 weeks. They were itm earlier this week, now $13 otm ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
You’re an idiot for not buying any puts at all…,
I'm bullish on Omicron $OMC.,
How funny would that title be if it the variant was named Xi instead of skipping to Omicron,
You were playing the market like a slot machine. Not surprised you lost.,
No you got fucked because you gamble with calls like a dumbass, trying to get rich fast. If it was easy, don't you think everyone would do it?,
What’s your tattoo say?? Omicron! What’s your tattoo say? Fucked me!,
A virus made you piss on an electric fence?,
O Nu 😱,
I want to reach this level of retardness one day,
I got fucked by Boris Johnson who set off the panic like a wall of dominoes.,
You got fucked by your own greed lol,
You the type of of bro that asks for butt sex on the first date aren't you my man.,
At least tax season will be friendly…,
You got time hope you doubled down!,
If you have a daughter Soon, call her that name, so you won't hate it anymore 😂,
Loser,
OTM lesson.,
Omicron sounds like a Jamaican dude with a big dick. RIP bro....,
If you mix the letters up it spells moronic. Which is you,
“IM FROM Omicron pussy I-8” - random big green dude from Futurama,
Sorry for your loss. Learn to cut loss. I know it sometimes prevents profit when the stock goes up. But most of the time it helps you from huge loss. Not having profit is always better than not having huge loss. Your $480 might worth to avg down. But 530 sell them,
Thank lur from omicron Persei 8,
This looks just like my portfolio but 10x,
Still time though,
Yep, it’s their fault.,
Seems you're adding to a losing position 🤔,
Or China?,
Omg this is brutal,
and the transformers thought unicron was bad,
Autobots assemble!,
You trying to hit them otm gains huh,
Dwacw fucked me up wore than that already.,
I mean u are 34+ on one of them,
We all did, waiting for printer take off in 3..2..1,
So calls on omicron then right? Sounds tech meme stock enough…,
Omicron is the name of your wife’s boyfriend,
Omicron? What the fuck is omicron?! Dey got magic beans dere?,
You’re still a fair way out from expiry though. Might as well hold at this point.,
O,
This is not enough fucking,
I see you made $34, that's a win,
What was your motivation behind so many different strikes? Esp all for the same expiration,
Yeah… you are in the wrong side,
Rip,
Monday or Tuesday green,
Omicron Persei 8,
😨😨😨 this is why you don’t over leverage on calls my dude. keep your head up and don’t let it get you down, it’s rebuilding time,
You've got 2-3 months of theta decay on your side. This could still turn around.,
Not one put as a hedge? Op you need help lol.,
Or you got fucked by still hanging in an obvious bubble.,
Omnicrons first victim 😖,
Never buy otm calls, too greedy junior..,
You should bank on these when they come out next week saying no cases in the US or vaccine is semi effective against it with new one to come out. You should be fine!!!,
😂😂😂,
SPY puts were the way, you didn't get the memo?,
Omnicron fuks,
That's why I only play 0 DTE spy options.,
your 100% going to recover some of that money back i hope u break even or make a huge gain but damn bro looking at these calls makes me wanna go all in on spy 😂😂,
You've just entered the cuckold stage my friend...,
You’re January calls will be okay. You’re December calls, eh…,
So fucked,
Sell now regert later. Guaranteed,
Still have more money than I do. For now.,
Same, worst part was for a second I was up large on Monday. Been shitting the bed ever since.
18x 490 12/17. RIP.,
Markowitz beats omicron invest don’t speculate,
I heard if you call robinhood you can get a refund,
Oh yeah. It’s gonna be a few weeks of pain, I fear,
Vin Diesel defeated the Omicrons as leader of the Necromongers! You don't stand a chance without an army!,
I feel like you fucked yourself using omicron against it's will,
Anyone wanna tell OP that he’ll be fine before expiration and should set up his sells for +20%,
Omicron - moronic 
Anagram,
Same but credit put spreads,
I always do the opposite of what I want to do and it never works,
Did it buy you dinner first?,
Your 480s might actually be fine. Not sure about the rest tho…,
It could’ve been called Xi but how dare anyone call a virus after a president 🤣,
It’s one day of bad trading. Hopefully it’s nbd like other variants and we’ll see upticks soon,
I am leeer!!! Leader of the planet Omicron persi 8!!!!!,
What app or exchange is OP using??,
Just buy the dip.  You’ll be strutting back to the slot machines in no time.,
Lol those were fucked way before covid omicron.,
You’re only fucked if you sell,
Spiegenheimer Doodoobutt,
Who buys calls over thanksgiving 😂,
Not sure you anything would have saved this pull my man. Always 2022 champ,
Xi fucked you dude,
I think you got fucked by putting all your eggs in several baskets of the same kind. Don't understand your "strategy" at all...,
Butt or mouth?,
Zero hedging. Good job. Keep it up.,
You haven’t even lost anything yet. Tf is this?,
You fucked yourself on that.. betting that the s&p goes up forever,
Wah wah wah. I had a million in oil stocks.,
LMAO gahhh damn,
by the unicorn 😄,
Did it at least buy you dinner first?,
34 profit on SPY! Go retard.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258),
Lol please tell me this is a joke, looks like I have the tablet to my 5 year old to trade,
Not so bad,
How come if the expiration are way before the omicron!? Please explain.,
They spelled gambling wrong at the top of your portfolio.,
Call the autobots,
LOSS PORN ✅✅✅,
No you pretty much fucked yourself. Typical millennial response; blame erything but yourself for a shitty investment. Hey you know the benefits for fucking yourself?  You probably have long dick to be able to do that. Cheers 🤡,
Your life depends on what narrative CNBC is gonna be pushing Monday morning.,
Omifucked,
If only you bought puts on Wednesday you’d be stupid rich.,
Red=Good ??,
Lol, I had $80 puts on UCO. Biden’s oil news fucked me with 30-40% losses in a day, only to sell and find a new entry point, then get fucking left in the rain with new variant. Fucking joke,
Who tf is omicron,
Someone else facked omicron. World is a fun place.,
I'm going to be real with yall, stocks that have big money in them, can be manipulated in a more severe way with the big dogs that are selling them. Scared money don't make money. 

My moves right now, EV companies and oil transport. Im anticipating TOPS ship to move fast and quick in the next week or so because Japan, India, US and others are opening their oil reserves. TOPS (Greek company) sold to Japan year or so ago because the Iranians were stealing their oil tankers. Go look.at the 5 years back on TOPS

I'll save you a trip to the Hood, it was 17.5 million per share. Now it's $1.15 a share. 

I found Spy calls, unless you're heavy in, it seems like.a sure bet, but be mindful of the BIGGER dogs who can influence that handle more than some turd in Western Kentucky that does it as a hobbie.,
Bro you seriously going that hard with calls when we’re due for a pullback and MACD solidly in red territory? You kind of deserve it….,
Just average down. Buy this dip and the next one on Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday and Friday. You should be green again before most expire.,
Me too 😩,
All of this is going to print by end of January. What’s the worry.,
Anyone else think that Omicron variant sounds like something out of Resident Evil?,
You’re gonna keep getting fucked too😭,
You’re fine. SPY rally right thru New Years.,
After reading all these comments, I think I might truly be a retard 🤦🏻‍♂️,
You won $34. Well played.,
I bought 10 SPY 470 C with 12/6 expiry on Wednesday, those are fuckin dead,
Friday was nothing, all the seniors were on vacation hence the abbreviated trading hours….. wait till Monday to see what’s really going to happen when the seniors are all back on the floor,
Should be back to normal by Monday,  hell I didn't even know the markets were open Friday,
U got lots of ⏲️.,
Keep spreading the fud yesss,
Any one of y'all got that goog good Omicron?,
Lmao drink up,
Wow! Sorry dude! I had all puts!!🤑🤑,
 Black Friday calls 🔥🔥🔥sales though... leverage more and go all out!,
It's Hilarious how Moderna dropped to 225 a Share out of nowhere.... the "Nu" (New) Variant appears...Now suddenly as of last night Moderna's  stock jumped over 50% to 355.  If you had cheap Options in them.. you are now filthy rich. Congratulations.  The New Age of Political Bribery is called "Suggestive Stock Trade Messaging".

COVID is Bullshit and this is all just a ploy to Make the rich richer and manipulate the Useful Idiots.,
No you didn’t - you could easily come back.,
530??? Wtf hahahaha,
Fuc**d by Lrrrr ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 😂😂😂,
Plenty of time on most of those.,
Lmao hey man in this day and age you might as well buy SPY 220 puts I’m sure those are better than ur perma bull tickets lmao,
I wrote those, HAHA,
I am Lrrr from the Planet Omicron Persei 8 🦎,
You bought 200 1/22 SPY $515 calls?  I’d say you fucked yourself friend, didn’t need any help from Omicron lol,
$530 1/21/22 calls. You are delusional,
9omini dick!,
Mutual of Omicron,
Beekend bow drilllllinggggggg. All equities to 0,
I got fucked by Corona and sanctions in general.

Should see my investments in inbev or airlines or venezuela or or or or.

Seems like whenever I decide to get involved in something, some jackass decide to piss on that turf :),
If you don’t plan on getting fucked on any market day, then you really just fuck yourself. Do you think the market and the world will just print you money on a daily basis.   You have 4 weeks, so either cut your losses or take a chill pill and wait for the Omicron knee jerk reaction to reverse for a day or too. K,
You won + $34.00 on one of them. Not a complete loss.,
Oh hey, I recently sold some SPY $530 calls with that expiration. Thanks!,
 
When will people learn options are not the play.,
It amazes me that people buy into this narrative that it will just keep going up forever. I made a killing on outs yesterday. One of my easiest and best plays ever. It’ll bounce on Monday for anyone who wants to rebuy.,
It’s a Black Friday sale! Omicron has maybe 30 mutations in a 1400 amino acid spike protein. It’s possibly, but highly unlikely that it’ll evade all neutralizing immunity.,
Get fukt bro,

Wife is a liability VS stocks are asset. I am buying call on your decision,
Just look at the monthly budget. Are the wife's numbers red or black? If you're not black, you have to go!,
Such a high quality meme thanks manchest,
This is called pulling an OJ,
Love TC,
where will you get your money to play the stocks? Don’t forget, She’s the one who gives you your allowance money!,
Which stock do you buy first after the breakup?,
No worries here.,
He's ready for a new helicopter.,
🤣🤣,
u can always buy a new wife with tendies,
Say no more fam,
And that’s how your wife gets a new bf,
Did he just dock ‘slice of life’?,
You can buy her back later.,
She doesn't know that if I nail my options right, I will buy her a better boyfriend. I might buy some new girlfriends too or I might YOLO everything into the next 100% guaranteed stock.,
Easiest decision of your life just make sure she takes the kids too,
This could also be your wife's bodyfriend.,
TC! RC! DFV!,
easiest choice u will ever make,
This guy believes in learning things by doing them.  So he threw her in the lake to teach himself CPR.,
TC you magnificent bastard!,
SEARCH MINERALS GOING TO ROCKET,

Puts on OP’s marriage,

Showed my girlfriend. Gotta make these things clear from the jump.,
You Dextered her?,
She just asked me to starting paying the electric and water bill. Guess she needs to get a boyfriend.,
I don’t get it? You turned into a Blackman?,
She needed to spend more time with her boyfriend anyway.,
Her boyfriend must be thrilled,
Hope she knows how to swim,
Doesn't your portfolio dip after she takes half of it?,

Hey guys I have $900,000 in cash. Should I put it in a plastic bag on the side of the road and check in on it later or do something meaningful with it?,
if its good enough to screenshot...,
Hey it’s me, your uncle,
Sell, you are already the richest person in Vietnam, raise an army and declare yourself Emperor,
The golden rule is that if it's good enough to share it's good enough to sell.,
Sell right now and retire. Put it on some index tracker and live off the growth. You've literally cheated the entire life rat race, don't waste it.,
Happy retirement!,
How the fuck did you know?,
You have 200 contracts. I would highly recommend you sell half at a minimum..,
Hold until it’s a loss,
Take profits and be happy.,
Sell half. If news comes out that their shot doesn't work vs the new African strain that could go down faster than I'll be having to behind the dumpster outside Wendy's if we get a few more days like today.,
Sell retard!,
You should charge your phone and sell,
Well he’s up to 1.4m now if he didn’t sell. Nice job op,
I wish I had $225K to throw around in options that expire in 2 weeks...that being said, congrats!,
Phuc you 🚀,
Sell,

At 1million i would do a Screenshot and after that i would sell,
"it's if good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell..",
SELL! You already won the game my dude.,
He identified the new variant and then bought calls. This is the way🤣🤣,
Sell, Mortimer, SELL!!!,
You can already buy all the hookers in Saigon. What more do you want?,
Congrats and fuck you. Why not take profit and sell half? Take that money and go out and get yourself a nice bowl of pho and some Viet Namese coffee,
[deleted],
Not financial advice.
But at 335 your options may be worth $70+. Fucking sell and enjoy the $1m plus you made in few hours,
The SEC would like you to send them a holiday card with a valid return address.,
200k into options that expire in a few weeks... Gets lucky because of Covid variant shit.. nice. Take profit bro.,
“Hello, is this the S.E.C?”

“Yes, this fellow right here”,
Do you guys wanna know my next move? It should print if you are patient. Btw, thanks for great advice😂,
Sell,
Never fall in love with a position. If u don’t know yet - time in the market will teach you that. 
Good play 🤙,
What a dunk, good shit OP,
Sell .lol just me I'd secure that bag,
Congrats. Take your profit, take 25% of that and reinvest in out of the money leaps,
Sell and retire! You won! Fuck you!,
Omg sell immediately. The easiest money was made on the surprise catalyst, take your chips and move on. Congrats,
Sell..this thing will tank when everyone realizes this new Variant is over reacted.,
Good lord you can live like a king in Vietnam with these money. Sell and retire, you won the game!,
Congrats and fuck you, hope you took some profits, what made you get in? what was your original plan if it didn't spike today with that expiration?,
Nguyen Nguyen either way,
How retarded do you have to be to not sell at a 730,000 dollar profit?,
This is a true happy ending...,
SELL, and live like a king. Don't join the retard army here.,
Da Fuck ya waiting for? Christmas? Exercise The Call and close this trade.,

Dude please sell and take your million dollars,
Fuck yes!,
How the fuck do you gamble $225k?,
Nice job. I'd say, if it's good enough to take a picture, then it's good enough to take profit. 
Now double down on a meme stock and make some REAL $$$, you know the rules of WSB!,
Sell and get yourself a mistress ten years younger than your wife  🎉,
This is nuts. Cash out and take like 15 years off.,
Bruh, just fucking sell. Dont be greedy. If u still want to have skin in the game, sell like 75% of it and keep a little.,
You’ll lose half or more of your profits in taxes (unless this is in an IRA).,

viet to viet, just sell it. you’re going to hate yourself if it goes to zero. take the 1M, put it into a good portfolio of 5-10 good stocks and hold on to it. it’s not worth it to hold on to it in hopes of 2M or even 3M. just my thought. good luck!,
Good job retard.,

Sell it tf you up $750,000 that’s a whole house or 2,
How much did OP actually risk to make this?,
saw the 951k and just assumed this would be a million percent gain but you're just rich. Don't think you should sell as they'll probably announce a booster shot for this strain in a few weeks.,
If it's good enough to take a screenshot, it's good enough to sell. 
Wise words I learned on Reddit,
Good enough for a screenshot good enough to sell nothing wrong with taking profits especially what you made,
Congratufukinglations dude you cheated life,
Fuck me, this random guy gonna be become the richest mother fucker in Vietnam,
Dude how can you buy options in US stock market in Vietnam? I also live in asia but there’s no way you can buy options if you are not a investment firm or sophisticated investor. Retail investor can only buy stocks not crazy call and put options,

Nu variant nu gains.,
Fucking sell....then go make some bad decisions.,
Take your gains bro, don’t be greedy, you’re already set for at least 10-20 yrs,

How’d you know this would pop?

Also fyi looks like you’re shadow banned, yesterday you said MRNA to the moon and I clicked the comment and I can’t see it.,

That’s a big dong!,
Sell half, keep half, continue options on 25% and go long on 25% and extend calls if needed? I dunno I'm just eating a crayon,
Sell half keep half. It's only worthless when it goes to 0,
Sell it. Today was a pump,
Sell,
Sell half and gamble with the other half,
I’m so pissed I had a 300 call earlier this week losing me money so I had to sell at a loss. Ended up all in on TSLA. Wish i at least held my one call. I wouldn’t be near broke right now… congrats though. I knew I’d see MRNA screenshots today. I could’ve made $4k off my 300 call alone.,
It will be over on Monday,
Buy more calls and hold till expiration,
I have only 1 contract and purchased on Nov 22 at $4.55,
Fuck off buy me a viet chick,

This is the most retarded thing I've seen all holiday weekend and I went black Friday shopping,
Since your the same guy who bought palantir and baba way too high I will inverse this position.,
Uh…..,
Double scam. Buying the scam stock and using the scam platform. Nice.,
Dullest tool in the shed,
I’m all in now,
Same I with you 5000 shares,
Large dark pool buying on that last week, those probably pay,
is anyone gonna tell him about the upcoming lockup,
Thank you for the loss porn. You can use an award!,
Well, it's a dogshit company.  What's the worst that could happen?  Oh, that.,
This thread has 0 upvotes on my screen, I comment because I find it suspicious that I also started a $HOOD thread in this sub and it’s locked at 0 likes also…. WSB anti RH bias,
I just love all the sad pathetic people here hating on OP just because of a controversy that most of them don't even understand. Apes? LOL More like sheep following sheep.,
Write those covered calls,
[removed],
Puts puts puts,
I have one question, why do you hate your money so much?,
this looks even more stupid then yoloing into wish.. hood is on a good way to sub 20 imho, hope you don't lose too much.,
Make sure you turn off the sell button when things get rough!!!!,
Let's go mate!,
OP, post it here! [r/bullishrobinhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/BullishRobinhood?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share),

It will hit $8 again...as soon as you sell.  We're all waiting.,
😂😂 if you're go-to money making plan is to rely on WISH rallying. I'm impressed you're only down 41k,
How about we promise that WISH will go up but actually deliver you something else like Wish does. Even my 10 year daughter knows that company is a joke. Just quit and buy a fang stock or something. 100% invested. You're definitively a retard.,
The next 27% drop won't be as painful as your first 27% drop.,
Always set stops, the opportunity cost of waiting on a potential return to even are far worse then taking the L, learning from mistake, and putting your remaining capital to work on better plays. If you really think WISH is coming back you can still dump all these commons, buy some OTM leaps for delta exposure and have the rest of your cash to put in a better play. This advice is coming from a fellow degen who used to have some WISH but cut that shit already and took the L.,
The best part about a 50% loss is that it takes 100% gain to get it back!,
Bet on bullshit you get bullshit,
This man yolo’d into a literal scam company that sells cheap chinese shit knockoff products. I’ll pray for that rally for you my friend, but if it happens, get the fuck out of that stock and try investing in companies with actual value.,
France is planning to ban WISH because of unsafe, fake items. So the price might crash even more,
The snowball in Hell has better odds.,
Ya know. It has the same probability of going to $0 as $8,
Hilarious that if you just bought SPY like a non-moron, you’d be up 25%, but instead have to hope for a bullshit rally from a bullshit stock to break even.,
If you average down to 3.90 it only needs to move a couple of cents to be a profit,
If it makes you feel better buy $8 puts and exercise them. You will force someone else to buy them at that price. You will still loose the same amount of moneys.,
No😂 wish has literally nothing going for them why the hell are you people still in,
Take the loss and move on. They'll probably get delisted eventually.,
Take your money and yolo into nvda youre welcome.,
Your only hope is that Amazon buys wish for... whatever salvage wish has to over. Maybe the real estate who knows.  

Just DM Jeff Bozo and tell him Elon really likes wish and is considering making it the homepage on the tesla dash screen.

It'll be bought by Amazon in a day and 10x,
Wait, people actually buy WISH ? 

I wouldn't even buy some shit they sell .. I would be crazy to buy a share from them,
I think next step is to create WISH recurring investment. 🤣,
37k is more than enough to start playing spy…starting with 5k and shooting for 30% wins, takes about 7 trades to make 40+k. Be patient and consistent,
Wish will bounce back when Sears buys them and partners with Blockbuster to create a toy rental and repair magazine.,
I would say it's pretty good it hits 8.


All it needs is to run under a dollar for a few months and they'll do a 10/1 reverse split and you'll get your price target.,
You WISH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile),
Lmao u WISH 😂,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
It won’t, goodbye your money.,
Sell your house and buy more,
Imagine putting money in a company as shitty as wish. The entirety of the internet considers them a joke. You deserve the red, retard.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Get out. 

So many ways to make money in the market and you don’t have to be hitched to this broke down horse. 

Plus, if your next play takes beyond end of year- you’ll have capital loss deduction for 2021. Unfortunately, if you have no gains to offset you’ll only get the benefit of $3,000 of the capital losses for 2021 and the rest will carry forward to 2022 (until such year as you have gains with which to use more than $3,000),
Yeah, I think you should double down on WISH. It’s the only way. Maybe way OTM weekly calls!,
Only if you $WISH hard enough.,
I see your average is only $5.35 did you sell cc?,
AMD and XLNX merger should be announced next month. Get some LEAPS and make some of your losses back. Moreover, MRNA has price momentum. You can Yolo into it tomorrow. If it gaps up pre-market Monday, watch it run to  360+. This is just a suggestion.,
It is called WISH, if you wish that many others will wish WISH to go higher, than maybe WISH will hit $8 again, the power of wishing,
Mission failed successfully,
Go to the website and look what you've invested in and then make your own decision.

Also, lots of bag holders at levels moving up to $8. People will be looking to offload their shares to breakeven at 5, 6, 7, etc. Lots of resistance to burst through for a pretty bad and still overvalued company.,
I think wish is toast. I had kept it on my watch list for a while... But I'm not convinced it's ever going up again. It's banned in some countries now, bad earnings, and no real catalyst outside of being bought, but who would want it,
Na chef sorry 

Take the loss before dec 31 for your taxes 

And bever 

Never
Ever buy anything from GYNA again,
Have you try making a wish?,
STOP BUYING WISH,
You've got more chance of the company going bankrupt and the share being delisted with all these items on wish not meeting regulations and some countries banning it. But hey, wish investors aren't logical and sometimes neither is the stock market. Good luck,
[deleted],
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
BK would be the best chance. Look at what Hertz stock did during its BK and into today,
Lol yea keep holding retard. Just keep the loss porn coming,
Nope it’s not going anywhere, did you miss every single wish joke the internet has made?,
Get out of this garbage company. It will go to 0,
The best trades are the ones everyone discredits ….I $WISH you make these fuckers cry,
Wish has a better chance of being delisted than reaching 8$,
Invest in something else loser.,
I’m impress your are only down 41k when you are taking positions in shitty companies like wish,
Sell wish and buy PLTR,
The right move is to cut the loss and learn from it. If you just can't or won't though you could sell 96 covered calls and start reducing your basis. It would take a long string of them to recover though and in that time the company may well go under.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
5 years or so,
Only way it gets to $8 is after a reverse split.  Business model is fundamentally flawed.,
I mean you could sell covered calls against it if you are planning on holding it to start reducing your cost basis.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
You went full retard. Never go full retard.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
I don't lose 40k often but when I do, it's on stonks like wish!,
Bruh you bought a company at 8 bucks. That means you already knew that they couldnt even do well as a company when people were forced to buy from online retailers, because of the pandemic.

If you bought at 30 bucks or so I would say that was a speculative play, but at 8 dollars. Come on, all the news about how bad WISH is, was accessible to everyone by then.,
Their shares are going down but honestly the story seems to be getting slightly better. 

I'm a bagholder but it seems like this is an undervalued company in a very frothy market.  Wish I never bought but at 5 bucks a share and 1B cash I'm holding out.,
Even with an average cost of $5.35, you’re still down 27%. Goddamnit WISH. Lmaoo,
You know, as retarded as this is, it reminds me a lot of amc as someone who traded it from $1 to $70. I think the one thing I learned there / in books like trading in the zone/ day trading for a living, one of the biggest factors in the market is people’s belief behind the stock. Could be a good investment once it bottoms out,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259),
You $WISH 😂😂😂,
You are a certified autistic.,
isnt wish basically a dropshipper of chinese knock offs that somehow went public?,
There are better ways to lose money, get out.,
I hope you've been selling covered calls on this while it's been dropping...

Either start selling ccs on it now to make back some of your losses or get out of the stock completely into a better company.,
Wishing for a rally isn’t going to make it happen. Cut your losses. I was down $90k last year, ditched all those companies, and started over this year. Now I’m up over $200k. You’re not Gollum. You don’t need to hold onto that ring.,
Just hold and sell calls,
Just reminding this is a vaccine time….,
It will go to $12 right after you sell...,
Still amazes me just how many people blindly throw money at trash like wish! 

Just give your money to charity or a friend in need if you're so eager to throw it away.,
Holding the bag sucks. Keep following the company. May be someday it will moon again. But I think it will keep going down and down. Most people don't even like the company and their products. They probably have to change their whole business.,
This is wall street bets. I don’t see any options in your photo, just a bunch of shares? 10,000 of them. Sell covered calls you dummy.,
Who cares you will ride it back to zero,
You have a problem.,
PROG,
The question of OP is exactly what I expect from apes! Good job OP, good job!!,
What you need.....is a ton of $$.  Corner the market on WISH.  Then you might be set.,
No one knows. I dabbled in wish and got out with a bit of profit. It's more or less a crap company but seems unlikely to go bankrupt. More lock downs might actually help it. I kept a few out of the money calls as a lottery ticket but I wouldn't want to hold the shares.,
When you $WISH upon a star, makes no difference who you are.,
Anything is possible but yuck.  If you must hold on, sell CCs at your BE and use that cash to sell some CSP or buy more shares to lower your basis and then repeat.  You might get to home base at some point.

I just looked.. You can sell 96 CCs for $4 each at $6 strike for Dec 10.  That even lets you make a few bucks if it rallies somehow. You might even get lucky and sell them for $5 each.
Thats $315 or something after fees.  Buy 80 shares.  On Dec 13, Sell 97 CCs at $6 and hope youve rallied to 4.50 by then and can get a better price on those $6s while your cost has gone down.  

Or take tha $300 and sell a CSP at $3 for an extra $8 lol, and then do the same thing on Dec 13, sell the calls, take the money and sell 2 CSP at $3 or $3.5, and now youre generating a little bit of cash flow and if you get assigned on the puts you at least lower your basis and have a couple hundred more shares to sell CCs on.,
Delisting coming in the future,
Nope fuck China they don’t want their own people to be rich,
Wish in 1 hand then take a crap in the other, just to see which one fills up the fastest.,
Inoressice you only lost 41k with investments like these,
Wish is fuk,
Holy fuck all the hate being pushed about WISH, is everyone shorting this one?,
U wish,
Stop trading garbage shit stocks............,
27%? Cut yer losses. You can get 27% back somewhere else. Shit. Just wait for spy to bottom. Wish was a scam hou got hosed it happens. Don’t wait till you’re down 64%. 
Think about the whole fool me once saying.,
Start selling covered calls to make up the difference. A dec 17 4.5 call is .23, at 96 contracts you could make 2200 from it. If it keeps going down then you won’t even have to worry about having to sell your shares and you could make your losses back in 4 months. Or if you want to just keep holding forever and you would be happy with getting $8 per share no matter what the price hits, you could sell some 14 Apr $8 calls for .35 each netting $3360 right now and possibly selling them at $8 if it ever goes back. If not you can just do that 4 more times over the next year and make your losses back. If it gets delisted though you’ll probably never make your money back 🤷🏼‍♂️ cut your losses and put it all into TQQQ since you’re fine with gambling anyways. Hold until infinity,
Better switch over to GME, wish doesn't have a prayer,
It’s a buy here and it could fill that gap at $9.50 if it were a real company.,
what made you buy that garbage in the first place?,
Unless you think it’s going to zero you might as well hold. Sell covered calls on some of the shares to get your average down.,
Go look at all the insiders selling it at 4$,
100% lmao,
why do people keep falling for this trap lol,
I bought wish when I was hammered and boy I tell you what. If it got up to $8 I’d be happier then Frodo seeing Gandalf in Rivendell.,
Money could be better use somewhere else. Lol if you got the balls to put it into a shit company you should have the balls to put it into spy calls. Cash out buy yourself some monthlies on spy on this dip and make your money back and some more. Freaking a all that MONEY and you put it in a shit company fck.,
No,
WISH is going to $0 before it hits $8 again,
Before dropping $50k on wish, did you first spend $20 to buy something from them off their app or site?  I would highly recommend doing that if you are thinking of holding this.,
No chance,
Yes. But not today.,
Them bags 💼 heavy,
sold mine dumped it in to tesla lol  when it tiped few weeks ago  i recovered all my loss and broke even  so im happy,
Hit that create recurring investment button.,
I will give you a way to recover your money, but it will require you to stop gambling on junk. I’ll give you a stock that will double in the next year. Hell, lets diversify. I’ll give you 3 stocks that will double within the next year. Buy them and forget about them. Fine, I’ll give you 5 stocks. For the 100% guaranteed 100% win. 
Here they are: MGY, SONO, EDIT, ROKU, FNKO

you’re welcome.,
Yes, I believe WISH is looking very juicy right now and expect an upturn,
Damn imagine all the people waiting to break even.,
Nope. Won't happen. Cut your losses and buy a better company,
I can’t tell you how many times I have been down 80-90% in my portfolio, if you try you can make it back easily,
I wish people would stop posting about $wish.,
$8 $WISH,
WISH IS F'D,
"Engages in the operations of an online marketplace that includes geek. Mama."

I'm all in ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Aaaand its gone 
Its gone,
Retard. Sell and buy AMD, SPY, and MRNA calls for the month. You’ll break even in 2 weeks.,
you know the company sells useless little trinkets, right?,
PROG 🐸,
Stfu ..💩💩💩💩💩 
Fake post,
to Wish haters : What was making AMC and GME unique. Please all of you bastards short this stock, so I can be orgazmed with your loss,
Bmtx,
Sell $WISH and put all your money into $ABNB right now! Airbnb just got hammered (along with everything else) because of bad news from the pandemic, but once it's over, it could easily double and then you'd have all your money back.

Moreover, $WISH has 99.99% of going bankrupt...,
Wait till the $WISH reverse stock split, then you can really brag about YOLO.  IMO, which is worth nothing in human mind, Next week is gonna be a blood bath on all stocks.,
I cried laughing when I kept seeing months ago “WISH is about to blow!” Yea these nuts, it was going nowhere.,

If it’s good enough for a screenshot you should probably sell, hope you got out today OP,
I don’t like being this hard this late at night.   OP you waiting to see where it goes from here before closing that bad bitch?,
You didn’t sell?,
Holy balls broooooo,
Wow, good for you. You’d better sell lol,
Sell half keep half. You lose only when it drops below your Principal. Thank me later.,
Fucking congrats. Stupid question, why wasn’t PFE up as much as MRNA? Up 6% vs 20%,
One day i wanna get the memo...,
Who has half a mil on Robinhood with 300 60 DTE single security and doesn’t sell? Not to mention debt ceiling as well,
Why do all my $2 option plays go to $0?,
👀 damnnnn dude! That took balls to make that play! Good shit,
these might actually hit,
New variant isn’t a big deal yet, but the market and Biden reacted like it is. I think you’ll make more money next week till we realize this one isn’t too bad.
Nice job!,
Congrats and really go disrespect your rear with a phallic object.,
Good fucking job, When did you buy the contracts ?,
Sell? Is everyone here dumb? Is this a meme response?  Omicron + thxgivin + Xmas Covid cases... this shit is about to go to 600 easily by Mid Dec...   it was 495 a couple months ago...,
balls of steel on this guy,
I believe this goes parabolic for the next month. $750 on deck,
Bro cash the fuck out,
Sell. Quit. Study. Return to market.,
Sell on Monday, don’t be a retard,
Always the robinhood screenshot, would you find another online generator next time?,
Sell all at 340 & 350. Will buy dip next week. Yesterday was panick sell & therefore total buy biofarma. But then it will cool down and we can buy it again and hold until 4 quater 2021 report.,
I'm curious as to when this was bought. The maths do not compute. Also the fact that some glorious asshole has $500k on RH.,
You should have sold or rolled.

Rolling allows you to take profit and still have a position.,

Hey /u/Krazy__cat, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
It's already been to $160, I think $180 is very possible by Q2 next year. Not sure about $200, maybe EOY 2022?,
I'm holding 85$ 1/23 and 105$ 1/23 calls, looking for $200 next year to start exiting my position.,
AMD will follow Nvidia chart
2.5d / 3D stacking NAND chips
Heterogeneous computing 
Ez 10 bagger

$200 2022 eoy easily,
Nvda underdog I like it AMD🚀,
Definitely true, intel is definitely behind, but next year I think it was around March that I two is releasing a gaming lineup, more powerful, and to get a foot into the door and catch up, it'll probably be at the same or lower prices as AMD and Nvidia, I've also been wondering if I should buy amd,
If this new virus variant helps Jerome Powell get the money printer started again then $200 should be possible yes.,
I got shares and 200c.,
I'm super bullish on AMD. You know their first truly gaming gpus were released ast year. And as a result Nvidia lowered their prices for their GPUs which is a great sign that that they feal the competition. 

I'm investing in both AMD and Nvidia, yet I see the room for growth is much bigger for AMD, they just need time. I think them being making CPUs and GPUs might give them optimizatin leverage that will pop up someday in the future.,
Easily by the end of Q1 2022. My target is $225 for this time frame.,
I bought long term options before the meta deal.  Worked out well so far.  Will continue to hold.,
200 is in like Flint.,
just gotta get more influencers all there to get ppl to pile in,
I think it could…but it also may not…,
My $180c for 9/2022 exp is up 12%. I just bought it a week or two ago. Might buy more if it dips again. Might sell and buy back in Idk yet,
Already got my 7/22 200C,
After doing some napkin math, I believe AMD will fall to the 120s resulting from the dilution after the acquisition is made firm. I think this expectation is reflected in the options open interest heavily skewed to puts as well. On technical merits, AMD will get to $200 in 4-5 quarters barring any macro events. Another interesting angle would be a speculative long on an FPGA producer that Nvidia could acquire, to compete with intel/amd. Lattice maybe? $LSCC,
God I remember selling 1000 shares of this at 18 after a bullish earnings,
"AMD to $200."

"Why doe?"

"Idk cuz like its like pretty good company I guess.",
It‘s possible but to be honest - the potential in the other direction is also very high.
I wouldn‘t buy a huge amount of it.
If you weren‘t brave enough to jump in very earlier, it‘s just crazy to jump in now,
$200 - yes, but when? AMD fluctuated in 78-95 range during a year since Aug 2020, so we can see this again and price will reach $200 in 2023 only.,
AMD is on a bull run, a lot of hype, but I believe it will come down to Earth. I would buy it at 90$.,
[deleted],
It’s easier for AMD to go below 130 than it is for Intel to go below 40 imho. You could be right in your call but in general I will stand by what I said as Just something to think about,
For 20 years AMD had been the little train that could, it's healthy, poignant, in TSLA vehicles, expanding, automation is exploding, Musk is one person, and finite, owning both nvidan and AMC isn't like owning wish,
Ath next week take it or leave it,
You lost me on  "Intel sized at 10 nm",
With our own government working to collapse the economy, I would say no.,
I've got out at $154. I have a feeling it's hit it the ceiling.,
You can get AMD 2200g for less than $100 at Facebook marketplace.,
Intel needs to leapfrog if they’re to survive. Blackberry got blinded by playing catch-up to apple. AMD looks way overvalued.,

There was a heist of the reserve between 2011-2012 that remains the largest heist in Canadian history. They stole 3000 tons of maple syrup worth 18.7 million dollars.

A barrel of maple syrup is worth about ~20x that of a barrel of oil.,
Quebec represents 77% of the worlds maple supply. They are the OPEC of syrup,
“Strategic reserves”……..I’m intrigued by this. What the hell are you crazy bastards up to up there?

Edit: murders apparently. You crazy bastards….I’ll take two bottles, please.,
Is this serious? Like the US and the gas reserves?,
My time has come,
Canadian here that makes maple syrup just as a hobby,

the past few years have been absolute garbage for production. Maple trees need consistent below freezing temperature at night and above freezing during the day for sap to flow, it's just how it is. With weather swings so sporadic, you can get a week of -12 constant then +13 for a few days then back to -5. The trees don't respond well at all to this and I've seen my own yields drop.,
Canada releases 50,000 barrels of maple syrup the day after the US releases 50,000 barrels of oil, sounds like a faux 4th of july joke, eh?,
"strategic maple syrup reserves" sounds Flap Jacky to me.,
Life is much simpler up here guys.  I think the whole world needs to chill the eff out and eat some waffles.,
It’s a cartel just like oil. They can tap more trees but don’t to keep the price high.,
Thank goodness!!,
Lmao,
Oh, the geopolitical implications! Will they extort concessions by holding the syrup hostage?????

\[Sarcasm\],
We're just chilling up here, sipping syrup, playing hockey, before we can walk we can cross check properly...

Source: https://youtu.be/F-glHAzXi_M

Edit: Oh, and price fixing syrup. We're doing that too. But it wouldn't be very Canadian to come out and say that... Not directly at least.,
They'll probably find empty barrels.,
Always knew the Canadians had wankers up there.,
Fuck, I just loaded up on syrup futures right before the bell 🥶,
Shouldn’t you guys be hibernating by now?  Go back to sleep.  We’ll see you in April.,
There was a badass mini documentary that vice about this.,
I’ve been stocked up for years waiting for this moment,
What happened to the guy that was talking about shorting maple syrup?,
They have to be hazing us. And it's working brilliantly.,
Does anyone literally anyone know how to publicly invest in maple syrup?  


If not, it may be time to sharpen the pitchforks,
Sooooooo..
Not just a reserve of maple syrup but a "strategic" reserve!?! Sounds syrious,
The syrup must flow!,
Thank God!,
the masculine urge to drop my next paycheck on maple syrup futures,
i noticed that for whatever reason people hoard syrup almost as hard they hoard TP,
Time to remind people about the [Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Canadian_Maple_Syrup_Heist),
Should’ve sold that syrup and bought some stocks. Stupid fucking canucks can’t even make money right,

Questioning the word “strategic.”,
Idiots. That’s to keep their lumberjacks going in times of crisis. Better pole numbers now, dead bodies later.,
Biden releases oil reserves and canada taps into its maple syrup! The world is ending!,
The Maple Syrup Cartels are no laughing matter. 

Back in the day their calling card was to stuff dry pancakes into the mouths of deceased competitors that were unwilling to be coerced out of business peacefully. "Nanny has a small side hustle selling syrup." is a statement met with incredible fear historically in Northern Quebec.,
Calls on $MPLE,

I figured US investors would happily ignore this and spy would hit $470 today… I buy calls and the buy the dip crown isn’t showing up,
I've been sitting on 1/22 458 puts that have been deep red for the last month.  Today is my day to shine!,
What is Powell doing? Even oil is tanking!  What happened to buy the dip?

This covid thing is not actually fun. I'm so over this!,
my spy puts were up 3000% today,
Yo im sick of these sissy ass investors panick selling at every news bit,
Same same. Shoulda bought those cheap puts on Wed instead. Even the $455 ones printed today.,
Ferb, I know what we're going to do today, lose money.,
Holy Dip Buying Batman!,
This fears on new covid varient are overblown. RIP spy calls,
I thought my hangover was gonna be the worst part of my morning.,
-97% at open on my 11/26 470c. Went down with the ship.,
Only idiots would buy call on tax season,
Lol you thought holding calls over Thanksgiving was gonna work,
Just bought calls.

For half a grand, so not much. Just for giggles. They do have a KO treshold.....4150 and I lose everything.

Love to hold them, when hovering at 2 cents and hoping they bounce suddenly back :) What a rush....,
lol, everyone saying this is tanking but you look at the charts and it is up 50% from 2020. It would need to drop at least 35% to even go back to 2020 numbers,
Hooray! 75% losses!,
My covered calls that were several strikes ITM are now worthless 😁,
Sometimes I wonder if the friends of that African doctor were making big bucks buying 1 DTE SPX puts.  I mean, like it's not even illegal.  It's just general news, not company specific therefore not insider trading.  It's like if I'm an astronomy hobbyist and I see an asteroid about to hit the earth, I'd tell all my friends about it on Wed before market close and then I'll announce the news on Thursday.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Can relate,
OOF,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
Anyone on calls today ? What dates and strike ?,

What's a total shocker? It's been detected in only FULLY VACCINATED people.,

😭,
Why are you wearing a VLC player shirt?,
When Wall Street infects Main Street, it’s time for APEs to go long.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
How can you see my account.,
IBKR liquidated my 0DTE SPY puts an hour or so before they went $2 ITM grrrrr,
Discovering something that doesn't exist,
Reached my max loss today. Done for the year while I'm still up. It'll be a boring last month :(,
It hurt... Lucky me bought some PUTs.... And some calls on $SH....,
480 12/31 already-40%,
[removed],
Cash is retarded. Buy puts. Sell calls.,
Personally I bought the dip because it's the same bullshit with every new variant that is announced,
Once doctors are on the tv saying the current vaccines still work everything will be fine,

Buy the dip, shell bounce back,
>Swing trading the S&P 

Tighten the straps on that helmet, kiddo,
Went 100% cash on Monday too. Saved mid 4 figure loss today.,
Should've gone VIXgang with that cash.,
tell us ur a closeted 🌈🧸 without telling us ur a closeted 🌈🧸,
My penny stock was up.,
Imagine not having any conviction plays 🤔,
Weak ass dip!  They frothed the market up too account for all future dips.  We barely rewond the clock,
I was close to going cash gang after being up 10% this month after going up 1000% the month before. Realized it was bound to come crashing down and thought eh, maybe I'm just smart?

Luckily only down 2% since opening my positions right now but fuck I am just going to keep bleeding my account week by week aint I,
Hey go fuck yourself. I went 60% cash the list 12 months and fomo’d in on Tuesday. Now 10% cash. Did I mention go fuck yourself?,
Lol. Same. I feel bad.,
Begin the DCA,
I have Bear ETF shares and and calls!!! I’m only dissapointed because this going to delay raising interest rates.,
Black Friday deals to go shopping.  CRYTPO space too.  F variants.,
I love this meme template but I don’t see it enough,
Fully in but somehow $brds went on a tear today,
And when it goes parabolic
You miss it,
This is how I feel right now after converting most of my money into usd from cad. Fucking dump cad to the ground.,
Hell yeah, cash gang is on the edge of our seats,
I bought drip and the gain was💯,
Why are people going broke when crypto has been climbing for the past 3 years.,

After I heard this I turned off cnbc and never turned it back on,
Buffett keeps calling me a fagg*t and telling me to buy the dip. Good to go except I’m all out of cash.,
Don't buy this dip yet, wait til after the first US case is confirmed, then buy the dip when everything tanks further.,
I’ll buy more ranch.,
Buy the dip! Powell is here to protect you!,
lmao just shorted the VIX before opening reddit and seeing this post, with the leverage i'm using if VIX goes above 33 i'm kinda fucked,
The last time I fucked a bitcoin I got an untreatable variant of crabs.,
What is this from?,
This is from the show 'Industry' on HBO. It's an incredible show, one of hbos hidden gems at the moment.,
Legit sold my BTC, bought SPY leaps and shorted UVXY at 3:50. By 3:55 I was already 10% down 😎,
Mine is to not check my broker again until next year,
I opened this up, then opened up a tin of edibles. My hands were full as I devoured 40mg and this thing played at least ten times on a loop. Now I can't get it out of my fucking head,
Very succinct,
Is this a new network? Could call it “ApeStreet”,
I'm of the camp that this was algo-driven, low liquidity nonsense. The US will pick up where it left off on Monday. Going back up,
The salt is real,

You weren't wrong, just early. Congrats!,
Now this is what we like seeing,
A legend walks amongst us.,
How'd you make it pink,
Lol I was crying over my $4k loss today but looking at this makes me feel so much better.,
Blow up show if you have the stuff to last. Now for your come back.,
u/abdulbosit1995 \- at your behest, the gain porn for the day.,
I would be clicking the sell on that gain so fucking fast 😂,
Hell yeah that’s sexy! Lol,
#Now double it,
I truly wish my knowledge of investing was higher lmao,
The balls on this guy, congrats 🔥,
I just got a Woodstock by see this. My wife is worried.,
What was with the jump in price around 8:30 this morning? My square calls also did that, briefly, too briefly.,
I made a weird face whenever I saw the first picture and I kept scrolling and then I just busted in tears.

WELL DONE,
how you flip it so good. i almost believe this is lost porn.. congrats.,
I clicked the image thinking I was going to see Kyler Quinn getting fuked raw,
That looks early in the day? Where do you stand eod?,
What gave you the hunch that SPY would tank? Usually I see these kind of YOLOs on calls, but what made you go for 1 DTE puts in such a bull market?,
How do you do fellow colourblind gambler? Gg on the gains.,
A lucky move putting everything on black (ba-dum tiss). Not sure what I learned from this other than the fact that I can safely predict you’re the sole piece of someone’s entertainment at a roulette table.

Fuck off now.,
Damn that loss porn folded out like a Penthouse centerfold.  What a chart.,
Wall street bets is literally just vertical lines for portfolio balance,

Lol every time bears get cocky and hold their puts too long

They never learn,
If it’s good enough to screenshot it’s good enough to close the position ya queer bastard,
i see you're paying homage to spy 100p 6/19/20,
Take the money and run, these retards will buy all the dips, all the time… and then banks have an extra $1.6B in Reverse Repo… there will never be a crash anymore, never… my SPY puts are there just in case we get a nuclear war or some strange shit happens like aliens invading,
Spy ripping on monday lmao,
Mfer Gona be in hiding come Monday EOD,
Check Wsb -> Bullish -> Still have more room to go down,
Never fell in love with a position.,
Oof. Should have sold them today you dumb fuck.,
wow your puts is so out of the money.. Monday spy Gain $20 points, you over!,
I just came here to say. 

RIP.,
This is "I walk around with BDSM leather and a strap-on in public during a family Christmas parade" kinda gay.,
If SPY rips Monday, this will instantly be worth the value of a homeless person’s shit.,
Did you pull out cost basis? Of course you didn't. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
I think red on monday too.  With countries banning travel, Austria in lockdown, Belgium and Netherlands getting close it's not looking good.,
These puts will be down like 80% at market open.,
Should have closed the position or at least half to ride for free.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
They announced the vaccine is effective against Omnicorn. Good luck.,
Have you heard of J-fukURputs-POW?,
Are you from the future?

Son. Is that you?,
No fucking way green by sunday,
You're being played both ways. Expect a reversal Monday to fuck over all the puts purchased today,
lol u wish, bears r fukt,
Did you sell this?,
Hope its triggered the next 5 days,
Toasty!,
Poots are fuck,
We all warned you that Friday was bullshit. Back to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀,
Save me a cup of your tears when you lose it all on Monday 😊,
Monday is 50/50 red or green. 

The narrative so far was panic panic panic....but that’s only because it’s the wee hours of this.  
The first time around, those who control the media were not in power. 

But Democrats decide what the news is....and if they believe Covid hurts them they’re going to minimize this variant to nothing 

and if it helps them they’ll close the world. 

Good luck,
ready for the monday loss porn 👀,
Gayyyy
Bannnn,
I'm an idiot who also bought a spy put on Friday: how would you sell one to actually make a profit?,

You immediately threw your entire portfolio into weekly SPY calls after almost losing it all??? Better add a few rockets for good luck 🚀🚀🚀,
Done this 3 times rookie. Watch it all go away again in a blink.
Definitely should have waited until after Monday morning to buy those calls it’s how you give it all back by being the slightest bit off on the next play,
Soooo, timing the market, looks so easy, where do I sign up!,
Fuck you and good job! What was the play?,
Geez. Was it really yolo or you do some DD on it,
Couple more lucky moves and we will have ourselves an analfarmer3,
Monday casino opens! Chaching!,
Fake Titties,

Nice,

If institutions are willing to pump a company with $0 in revenue to a valuation of +100bil valuation, I don't think we should call them "smart money" anymore.,
Thank you Mary Barra for leading the electric future,
Couldn't help but laugh out loud every time i heard *bag holding*,
Jeff Bezos is the Rivian of Space Travel,
When Ford dropped the Lightning I ran for the hills.,
Marry you did that, single handedly. I am serious.,
I feel like I need to do a DD post on Rivian... 

Not saying they aren't overvalued but I have been eyeing their tech for years.... they aren't a bullshit company like Fiscar. They design their own shit...,
🤡,
For those of you dumb enough to buy a Rivian/Lucid/Fisker, I implore you to lease it. Do not finance it. Do not pay cash (lol who am I kidding). 

That way when the company collapses and the value plummets, you can turn it back in after a couple of years.,
I was going to invest in it but I’m glad I didn’t.,
Bon voyage retards is the funniest thing ive read in years.,
I think $RIVN is headed the way of $WISH.  No one here at WSB believed me about $WISH.,
I’m getting the SUV it’s sexy.,
Rivian is not the next Tesla.
Tesla is the next Tesla. 
No company in history has even come close to this level of vertical integration while actually producing on a mass scale, their growth is exponentially growing at over 50% (I suggest you play with a calculator to get a clear understanding of what exponentially growing over several years leads to). With the launching of 2 new GIGA factories with a 2mil output each! ( and I am sure by the time they are ramped up another location will be announced or even possibly have ground broken…point being that 50% yoy will become a monster by 2026,27… I don’t see how anyone will ever be able to catch up!?  
I can’t remember what analyst said this,
“Tesla is like the white mechanical rabbit at the race track.  You are never going to catch it, so you better hope you are at least the fastest dog in the race” ;p
I’ve worked in a Chrysler assembly plant building the Pacifica.  Trucks and train loads drop parts off all day every day from all over the world, then it gets assembled there. That’s how it’s done in Legacy, cuz that’s the only way it could be done back in the day if you wanted to produce high volume. The logistics are insane. Anyways at Tesla raw materials go in one side and a finished product out the other side (for the most part anyways as lots of smaller things do get outsourced at Tesla, just not at the same scales). Tesla builds a car in just over 10 hours. Next best is VW at 35 hours. Average on the whole industry is around 42 hours I believe but I can’t remember and am to lazy to check right now. That is insane and the Berlin and Texas are going to be even quicker!!! Wow sorry ppl I blazed one and just started typing. I really didn’t mean too. 
Uh so yah Rivian is definitely not worth that. They have years to go same goes for Lucid. I’ll pick up some shares when it crashes the second or third time, maybe…,
I like the car though!,
Classic ending OP!,
I made more than my car is worth shorting Rivian this week. Cheers!,
I cannot stop laughing,
Amazon has contracted Rivian to produce 100,000 vehicles for them by 2024. Knowing the curmudgeonly tendencies of Bezos, I sincerely doubt they’d have entered into that agreement if there weren’t something to this company,
i've seen better memes on 9gag,
Is there any real reason why Rivian's stocks are plummeting? ...The product seems good enough,
this is actually hilarious because it's so early,
The angle of the truck going uphill is wonky. Just saying.,
Don’t forget Rivian has sexual harassment lawsuit pending which could be bad.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
🤣🤣🤣🤣,
Rivian is a joke. I cannot believe anyone would place a penny in a company like this with Tesla already cranking out a million vehicles a year,
I actually timed this one right. Feels good man.,
It's not 'The Next Tesla'

It's the 'Next Best Thing to Tesla'

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert, don't listen to me, I don't know what I'm talking about.

But yea....,
I made 100% on puts. Not much but it’s honest work.,
I remember when ppl said Tesla was going nowhere. That Elon Musk is nobody.

Well, here's a new great opportunity for me. I'm not going to miss this one like I did with Tesla.,

Hey /u/ForNuyr, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
Some ones looking for a pump.,
I was at a friends place and their kid was playing Roblox. Literally the dumbest thing I've ever seen and the kid was enjoying it. He was just hopping in circles, screaming his head off while being chased by the worst rendered zombie things I'd ever seen.  I didn't want to ask if their child was on the spectrum. I'm on WSB so who am I to judge. But the kid spent the few hours I was there just hopping in a circle yelling on the mic and having a blast.,
So buy tesla?,
I've always refused to pay extra for "free" games... but today my daughter figured out that they sell gift cards for Roblox and that she can ask other family members for Roblox gift cards for Christmas. I'd feel bad telling others not to get her what she wants, so..... Fuck it! I'm cash gang right now and I'm going into Roblox hard. I'll make a side bet that she gets over $200 in fucking make-believe robux for Christmas.,
There has been no reports at all of the new variant being ‘very deadly’ I’m in,
Sell signal,
The only DD I need is that Pelosi has Roblox so I bought a bunch on that alone. So far so good.,
Nope, terrible time right now. I bought in at $135 last Friday. It’s been downhill since then. Wait until I panic sell before you buy.,
USA will not go into another lockdown however pandemic plays will go back up if covid is bad.. roblox catalyst has been the meta verse and the fact that the company had a good earnings coming out of the pandemic,
I've been playing RBLX since earnings. Up days  and down days are predictable. Lately, in the span of this week, I've noticed this stock simply refuses to go down and hold losses. I would argue; from a simplistic perspective, that this stock stands to benefit due to Covid. Go long as the meta verse is recession proof.,
Everything will come back eventually.,
My january $100 puts aren't looking so shit hot,
I’m in 1000 shares.  Let’s do this shit.,
Theyre way ahead of a lot of other tech - theyve been doing  metaverse for years. 

If you buy one thing for the rest of this year RBLX is the one.  on sale now too.

not investment advice, written by retrd,
You do you. I don't understand how this ugly, grindy mess is 70bn dollar worth. On short term, sure, go to 150bn. Roblox will likely be a memory in 2026 at 5bn valuation. 

It's just another hype:     
- metaverse     
- epidemic 

"ready player on" showed it. What? Literally any game has more fleshed out gameplay than Roblox games. Parents and Relatives who don't know what do with their money see children playing it hence it is an awesome investment? 😄,
🤡 RBLX is going to go up because of the new variant, but is down because of the new variant🤡,
Yay!!! Bought when it came out. In 10 years it’ll be huuuuge,
I turned $4K into $104K on RBLX calls from earnings and the run up after (can post pics).  My entire kid’s school plays and all they want for Christmas is Robux.  I visited Niketown and it was pretty cool and walked away with a Nike hat and backpack.  Companies are tripping over themselves to collaborate with Roblox.  

I believe it’s the new social.  They’re growing in Canada, Russia, UK, India, and east Asia.  Stupid fact about me is that I spent a couple hundred on my avatar and spent $300 on the Dark Matter Gun in Big Paintball.,
I don’t think anyone cares about COVID anymore,
Yup. 
Solid thinking. 
Seriously.,
RBLX failed to make a profit during the entirety of the pandemic thus far, why do you think it will be different now?

Edit: These comments are a fucking hot mess. I can tell 99% of the people posting haven't actually ever looked at RBLX's earnings reports or financials.

> With tech companies it is all about revenue... not profit and their revenue is increasing... biggly.

Case in point.,
RBLX has been there teasing me and when it hit $70, i was like no fam, not today. I cry at night looking at his pic with NET at his side.,
Check VRAR,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
I don’t think this will move the needle if it only happens in a few countries.,
RBLX should be a Must Buy during Winter months.,
If Rblx can work to expand its customer base and get corporates to use them for virtual meetings then maybe why not,
Rblx and Nvdia call holder. Hopefully both rocket to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀,
[My $365k calls agree with you](https://imgur.com/a/KDryINY),
I have 3 kids a a grandson who all play on any and everything they can play Roblox on. It's huge and will definitely grow.,
Yeah everything will be going up in the long run,
$RBLX gonna be legit insane over Xmas. All my nieces and nephews want Robux from Santa,
Pelosi owns a bunch. Will moon,
*It will go higher because you know the "metaverse" shit or whatever the fuck...*  


Wow, solid DD, man. You should apply to work at a hedge fund in Idiocracy.,
Decided to buy some roblox yesterday because of you and just made me some tendies. Pulled out on my 132 C for Dec 10. Thanks for the "informative" DD,

I don't get it. How is gold worse than bitcoin, than GME, than Tesla, than Wish for god's sake. Is it not "cool" or something,
Nah this was a straight up gang bang,
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/fe2sio4 (4/5) made a bet that NIO would go to 43.0 when it was 41.275 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.,

Stocks are at 100  
New variant emerges  
Stocks drop to 95  
Variant turns out harmless, bringing us to the prior state  
Stocks skyrocket to 1000,

“Still, even epidemiologists who have been the most outspoken in urging protection from the virus urged calm on Friday, noting that little is known about the variant and that several seemingly threatening variants have come and gone in recent months.” 

Bruh- if you don’t want people to overreact then don’t induce global panic when you literally know nothing about the new strain!,
I overtip on the holidays. You think that the bartender, server, or manager wants to be there Black Friday keeping the lights on? Probably they do not, I have been in that spot. I still go out and bring the family to have a nice time. I order extra, I overtip, and I do not complain. I also make a living trading each year with my returns from the market. The backbone of this system is using your wisdom to help your fellow man, the karma always comes back. Cheers,

kind of come to the conclusion that one of my good friends from college is a fucking loser with no comprehension of how the world works. still living with his parents, his parents joke about him doing nothing with his life to me while im there, chain smoking cigs, smokes pot all day. what makes it worse is im doing pretty well and whenever I mention some things that i'm doing he will call my purchases stupid or if I talk about a buying property he will say that he is saving and talking to realtors and that im the one who cant afford it lol. im not sure what to do about it anymore, he barely talked to me when I hung out with him today because he was either really high or just invested in playing new world lol. I feel bad but he isnt really doing anything to help himself,

New variant: more transmissible, likely less deadly. OMNICRON is our saviour. MRNA puts are the way.,
All this variant stuff makes me think back to those few epic days in March 2020

Thursday 3/12 - sports leagues suspend season, goods flying off the shelf, everything appears fucked. Circuit breaker. I buy puts after circuit breaker

Friday 3/13 - Mango brings every CEO of major retailers to white house to stay everything is fine. My puts seem fucked

Monday 3/16 - clearly things are still fucked. Circuit breaker. 15k gain

On May 7, WHO labeled delta as a variant of concern. Between the 7th and the 12th, SPY proceeded to drop 4% before bouncing right back. 

We’re down 2.6% on SPY right now. Might go down more but don’t be fooled. The government can not force a lockdown anymore - there’s no political capital left for such an unpopular move. Everyone’s either vaccinated or has antibodies plus we’ve got treatment pills from Pfizer and Merck that will probably be approved very soon.,
Remember the Delta Variant? Me neither,

When you were buying puts, I was buying leaps. When you were going cash gang, I was using the last of my remaining margin to buy weeklies.

J fire up the printers babe.,
wait everyone saying its a overreaction and mild symptoms , did a report just came out?,
Either Omicron is absolutely nothing to worry about, like Lambda and Mu were

Or, we're two weeks away from finding out it's been here long enough to create problems and it's more contagious with more severe side effects.

Frankly, I think it's gonna be absolutely nothing and everyone freaked out for nothing but our country doesn't sequence for variants until their found so who fucking knows at this point,
COVID is over, feed the boomers to the market monster, let us live,

Just plain silly how a bit of fear can spread faster than any virus. One article and the market goes mush. Welcome to the stock market where one bad word can tank markets,
out of all the puts i could buy, i bought ZM puts EOD. i should just quit trading.,
Santa lost it all on SPY calls ..no Santa rally this year :(,
At least now I can buy SPY stocks instead of options,

Looking back at when the news about the delta variant broke on July 16th (a Friday) the market dipped roughly 500 points and then again on that Monday the 19th the market dipped another 700 points. Following that by Friday of that week we hit ATH’s.... do with this information as you will retards.,
SPY is coming back to its senses next week , whoever is shorting it is going to get fucked,
Monday is gonna be so green once they find out it's no big deal. Good thing I bought puts,
I know its still no nut november but this month I nutted more than any other month,
I'm holding MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, GOOG and FB and I am still getting rekt. 

It's like there is no future,

South African doctor who first reported omicron says symptoms are strange but mild, including tiredness and muscle aches, but no loss of taste or smell. If true then the media caused the Dow to have the worst day of the year over a new strain that makes people feel like the day after they hit the gym?,

My entire life savings is gone if SPY ends below 450 this week. I have never been so stressed before,
I predict the omicron variant will just be more of the same. The vaccinated and mask wearers will continue to be fine even if they contract the virus, the antivax and anti mask dumb dumbs may get infected at a higher rate but they’ll continue to believe anti science bullshit so it won’t really matter. It will be just a prolonging of the same pandemic, not necessarily much better or worse. This has been predicted and warned about as long as significant portions of populations refuse to get vaccinated and also refuse to follow other guidelines,

/u/DutchFloris (1/1) made a bet that ZIM would go to 60.0 when it was 50.94 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.,

O fuck they gave the variant a greek letter.,
Option premiums are a joke, impossible to make money in this 🤡market anymore.,

Ethiopia has a 1.2%

Nigeria has a 1.5% 

Trade according,
if we get another March 2020 covid crash the market will go right back to "easy mode" right? or am I missing something?

I managed to lose a lot in 2020 as I was learning, made up for it in 2021

but I still wish I could get to play in the "easy mode" knowing what I know now

yes I understand 2021 was not the "hard mode" yet,
Someone needs to get on making a covid variant Pokémon ripoff. You battle your variants and can collect them all. And they can “mutate” into more powerful variants when you level up.,

OPEN THE CASINO 🎰,
I was down $18k on my SPY 400 puts when the market opened. The $10kish I had left in their value surged around 120% today, and I closed the position down $6k.
  
Maybe it'll keep dropping Monday, but anything less than another blood bath, and those puts would have lost value.
  
It wasn't a winning trade, but I got out without losing my shirt, and I'm very happy about that.
  
We'll see what happens Monday.,
Oh god I bought SPY calls 20 seconds before close,
Remember when stocks went up,
went from +2k on amzn 0dte to -7k

south africa's COVID data is all screwed up. Google says on 11/13 there were 277 deaths and that the average number of cases per day was 275. That isn't possible unless like 1/7 people are dying (theyre not). They were way under-tested and now that they're actually testing it's going to artificially look like a massive influx of cases,

Why cash?

Why not crayons?,
Final nails going into evergrande coffin is the story,
Lol. Look like a fool for losing 5% to inflation beats losing 20%to retardation,
Rotation to tech…….? What are u talking about and where have you been…. Everyone and there mom is already in tech….. there’s nobody else to roll into that trade it’s full hence the ath last week….. it would be a rotation into value…….,
Have you heard of real estate investing? That would be an alternative,
2% drop and we are getting these doom threads. Are you serious right now?,
They are luring the market to buy puts.,
Market is begging for any excuse to crash.  Nobody gives a shit about covid anymore.  But a little bad news and that's all it took.,
Jamie Dimon is holding like 500m in cash because there is no better alternative,
Most of my investments are in municipal bonds and I am actually in the green right now.  Not by much but a lot better than I was this morning.  Around 10am I was -11k.  Whew.,
YOU’RE GOD DAMMED RIGHT…
==================================

The 10Year is down to 1.475%…

JPOW’s printer is powering up.

Taper is on hold.

Rate hikes are on hold.

Solid US Tech is the way.

Travel and Hospitality are radioactive.,
"Holding cash is basically losing money"

This is one of the most retarded parrot arguments I've ever heard. Anyone who has ever gotten gaped from being invested heavy when a bear market starts wishes they would have CASH, not more SPY. 

If you invested near the the height of dot-com, you'd have to wait 12-15 years to be back to break even depending if you count for inflation. That is some serious bagholding. And yes, of course there is cost-averaging for long term holding...but what fucking sub are we in? WALL STREET BETS. 

Nobody's thinking about the long-term buy and hold. And no one is thinking of buying more when their position is down (80%+), especially if it's options. We want yachts, coke and hookers NOW!

...but i think there are some here that truly want to give blowies behind the dumpster and live in a box for karma and sympathy points. Being a victim of society is really 'in' these days.,
This the op ex dump they’ve been staving off to sucker punch retail.  You are 100% right.  Where else can you go with the money?,
There really isn't a crystal ball to determine the course of inflation in the future. The incredible tidal wave of cheap Fed money has created a classic economic cognitive dissonance. We just can't calculate what will happen. While the 6.2% through the year is vastly disturbing, it may not be indicative of the future. And asset inflation, prodded by endless QE and bond purchases, has resulted in financial dissonance. We pay more and more, for less and less asset. At a certain point, one wants to hold onto some cash, even if it costs you.,
You just said holding cash is dead but my portfolio is 30% cash so who’s really ready for Monday then huh?,
Absolutely right, there is nowhere to hide where valuations arent already sky high (housing, stocks, cryptos, precious metals, collectibles/art).

But where you're wrong is to think the market is rational.

It's not. And there is still plenty potential for more panic.

Or to create panic on purpose, by someone with enough resources and techniques to profit from that.,
the fact of the matter is pulling out of the market guarantees a loss yep. An alternative is magic internet coins as well i guess.  


Btw all the people that talk about "bull run" have you ever charted the DJI vs M2? what bull run are we in? causeeee i dont see one.,
I bought nvidia before the close.     Oil is tempting as a straddle.,

Fuck that variant. The market will forget about it and move on.,
WFH coming back, long Jergens,
Fact: cash is a depreciating asset, like a car and your tits.,
Governments are gonna use this to backtrack vaccine mandates and reinstitute work from home with or w/o vaccine. They gotta pump the fear first and that is going to happen this weekend.,
In the US, we print so much money each that people turn their wealth into shares of useless companies where they print equity to dillute even that into nothing.,
I think moves were exaggerated by low trading volume.  New variant with no proper info and mrna goes up 20%? 1/5 of it's value? A bit too much. And also why ecommerce sector is also down on the news? MU products benefit also from lockdowns so why also tanking?

I see lot of panic buy and sell as if covid just came out without considering that now exist cures and vaccines. Yes oil/energy and travel/airlines stocks might continue to suffer in the short term (lockdowns in Europe) but how about amazon, adobe, crm etc? 

Let's see what will happen monday. My forecast is between +0.6% and +1% correction. 
I personally was waiting for a bit of dip in NVDA/AMD and now im fully invested,
This is a dip for buying. 
No underlying fundamentals have shifted. Just a spooked market over the ongoing pandemic. 

Technically speaking many assets are at technical levels to buy in rather than sell. 

That was our black friday sale, before the christmas melt-up.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
Nah bro the drop has nothing to do with the variant or this virus … all about something else and media is just using it as an excuse to something hidden from the retail traders.,
Is this a joke? I sure hope so,
The inflation, despite what everyone says is probably transitory. If the iran deal goes through, oil falls through the floor  and so does inflation,
What's the over/under that the latest variant is engineered?,
Just remember a 30% loss covers a lot of inflation.  If you can take profits and buy the dip a few months later, you will be better off.  Even better is to hedge.  Buy SPY puts to cover any expected drop.,
So what products do we export from Africa that we have to go without this winter? I mean they close entrance to more than 5 African countries. 😶,
Wouldn’t land or real estate be safe place to park cash?,
Most people aren't going to have to do much to rotate into tech stocks, it's already the most crowded trade in the world,
I think your right. It's payday next week and I'm buying the fucking dips,
[removed],
I think that it’s best to always be invested and not to hold cash because that way you can build your portfolio collateral up and if things hit the fan, you could always borrow from it. So In essence, a big account is the same as having cash around. With high inflation likely to happen, borrowing at a fixed, long term, rate is very smart to do.,
TQQQ 🚀,
QQQ is up 30% YTD and omicron variant lookin like it gonna run up covid numbers and lock downs for a few months. I think buying a 2-5% blip is too early.

>Early PCR test results showed that 90% of 1,100 new cases reported Nov.   
24 in the South African province that includes Johannesburg were caused   
by the new variant

Personally I like being \~30% cash here short term. When delta cases started spiking market pulled back 8% and it took about 1-2 weeks for everyone to absorb all the info and determine how much they wanted to sell. Around SPY 440-450 and QQQ 370-380 are my dip buying targets this round.,
Silver is the new currency,

When you owe 300billion, its the banks problem. When the bank is the CCP, it’s your problem.,
Imagine getting margin called by your dictator,
1.2 billion shares for 344 million.   Forced to sell at rock bottom.  That's Tuff 🔥💯,
Countries shouldn't bail out private company's. I can get behind this. Never too big to fail, you just get replaced.,
So he's working in a restaurant or moonlighting as a butcher?,
Dude should've ran his business from the US, where he would of gotten promoted into a government agency for this. Maybe even the new head of the SEC.,
Only 299.7 billion to go!,
the walking dead, literally,
Time to cut and run.,
Did he cut his stake or did his stake cut him?,
Maybe he could bribe someone and they'll seize teslas plant and give it to him so he can build his own electric car.,
Who bought the shares?  The market?
What did he do with the money?
Is buying out the CEO really a punishment?  What else are they doing to this guy?,
The thievery just keeps on going its like the Lehmann situation when they keep dragging it out delaying the inevitable.,
Really though, how is Evergrande going to pay its debt off. There will have to be write downs or restructurings and even then.,
AND DENNNNNN?,
With 299.7 billion left to go his only option is really to YOLO the $344M into options,
I can’t imagine that dude is able to sleep at night.,
Met him at a massage parlor last night lol,
he looks like he might have 3 copies of chromosome 21,
What does that mean? 

Buy leaps? 🤑,

Awesomeness,
Congrats! Had something similar a few weeks back when it finally passed 45 and went to 50. Gotta few 55 calls, but what about puts; im thinking this is gonna dump and fill the gap sooner than later. What you think?,
You did something just to impress a bunch of anonymous, heartless degenerates in a dark corner of the internet?,

i used to have 5 contracts but sold 2 in the early morning then i sold 2 more just now so i have 1 left going to let it rideee,
I said this before and I'll say it again, winter season = 'rona season. The media will continue to hype  the fuck out of this. What other major news stories do they have now? Everything on the news is fluff so they'll definitely will go into overtime and hype 'rona.,
I just found out that you can't buy shares on weekends. Not sure if I should be in this sub and listen to its advice.,
Really nice,
Ditto. Helluva ride. Cheers 🍻,
I had the same call. It was a good morning, great play!,
You sick son of a bitch,
Honestly I think it will go back to the 400s soon,
Sell one of those and let the other ride until Tuesday.,

Hey OP, newbie here, what app is it and what are you doing? Buying call options?,
Jesus Christ,
Can someone explain exactly what OP did here?,

I too have a decision to make…. You see, Im thinking of, and willing to, take a shit in 20 minutes….however, this play could be retarded, we will find out in 20.,
Those aren't LEAPS, and you'd better hope the Fed stops even whispering in a hawkish tone.,
I like the play only to see if it’ll fill that gap on the daily,
My call is -96%,
Pineapplebrat and snippets of a 14 year old football prospect isn’t worth billions of dollars.,
I see a major opportunity here and put about $200k in on leaps in February. Snap has had a history of beating expectations by a lot. Given where there stock price is now, analyst expectations and the technicals, I’d say the stock is poised to hit at least $65 in my opinion. There’s almost a major gap above $60 and those typically get filled so we might see this thing hit $75 by end of Q1.,
I'd like to see how it plays. Please keep us posted,
Personally I don't like the business model or see the company becoming like Meta.

Don't see how Twitter and Snapchat will become that level.

But for trading, Snapchat could easily rebound back to $70-80.

So buying a leap for some recovery might work. But long term I just don't see it.,
The chart looks primed for a bounce,
I have 88k in twitter 49$ leaps,
Fuck leaps, load them FDs let's go 🚀 lmao,
I bought 450 2024 leaps on spy. A 10% gain in spy equals a 50% profit for me based solely on delta not IV. If spy only gives 10% yoy I make good money. But spy has done a lot more yoy.,
Do people still use snap chat? All my homies hate snap chat.,
my jan calls down 65%,
I don’t know a single person that uses snapchat,
What the fuck does snap even do ? Their platform is losing users left and right. Revenue making is getting harder for them. Their other gadgets are garbage. What exactly is snap doing which is great ?,

if GME or AMC finish green tomorrow ill suck my own dick,
All I know is my AAL calls for Jan are not bouncing back in time.,
Only WSB would consider a deadly virus to be a buy signal for a movie theater stock.,
Humans going to die out. I'm going to start my own market with hookers and blackjack.,
But my spy calls were set to print today,
Looking at premarket… it’s definitely going to cause margin calls.,
Thank fuck I have some money to buy this crash,
Sure, could be part of the smoke screen.

*Negative Beta doesn't mean the stock price will move up if the market goes down, only that it has trended that way over a certain time.  Negative Beta means a big fat zero for this.,
I almost spit my drink out at “and therefore act as a hedge against falling markets”,
The recent delta announcement lasted about 1 day, and by the end of the week everything was more or less bought back up. I don't see this being much different.,
Just because the Beta is negative does not mean that they go up when the market goes down. It means that they went up when the market went down. Meme stocks will get beaten down just like normal stocks...,
"These stocks are already hedged against falling markets" says the OP right before they drop twice as much as the SPY.,
Buy the dip and pray to JpowPow,
AMC is down like 6% pre market right now.,
I'm in Florida. 
Covid ended like a year ago,
Day traders bail, investors buy.,
So done w this shit. We will never escape,
I thought this was a shit post then checked my portfolio. WTF!!,
How exactly will AMC go up if the world locks down again? I mean it could because… reasons. But generally movie theaters and brick and mortar would be most hurt.

So expect AMC and GME calls to get wrecked in this scenario.,
Doesn't Evergrande's 30-day extension on the October 29th coupon payment expire Monday? This story, with zero data or details, is perfect cover for global financial distress.,
Lol its down all >5% in pre-market its def not negative beta, it falls in line with the markets,
Rarely have I read something this stupid,
Negative beta has no predictive qualities… it’s just a historical indicator. However, margin calls are definitely coming if the market keeps this trend.,
Is this what's helping my stupid PTON gamble pre market?

Ride on Becky,
The omicron variant will specifically target everyone who isn’t physically standing inside an AMC theater or GameStop at all times. Stay safe!,
GME as a hedge against falling market? LOL. How high are you?,
GME a hedge against falling markets! 😂 

Heard this BS so many times, and it is totally false. 
GME ALWAYS drops the hardest, on red market days.
I’m long GME, TSLA, AMZN and MSFT.,
Market is fuking sliding at 4AM,
Meme stocks will get hammered in an actual crash. Shorts will make bank.,
If it's a part of any index or ETF, it's going down in a market wide correction. Negative beta doesn't mean anything in the scenario you're talking about. People holding meme stocks are likely holding other things as well so a market wide correction implies they are forced to sell other holdings. A big part of the reason why meme stocks shot up was due to call volumes. You won't see that again because the IV is too expensive and will become more expensive with a market wide correction. So as others are saying, its more likely to stay flat or fall with everything else.,
“Show me your friends and I’ll show you just how retarded you are”- John Donne,
Luckily I got BTFO on Wednesday and already got margin called (futures options are a joy),
It’s an excuse. Simple as that.,
I agree with a lot. But the world ending variant won’t be used to eradicate shorts from meme stocks. Reason for this strain imo is to knock the market down, and then it can have its Santa clause rally. The only way the shorts leave htbs is a true market failure, and it crashes. Then nobody wins,
What? What fuckin R2D2 C3P0 ass bullshit is happening now?,
There will be no lockdowns, shutdown mandates, or any other stupid, over reactive plan to deal with “Nu.” Move along, folks. Just more bullshit brought to you by a fear-mongering media circus begging for attention this holiday season.,
Senseonics gonna moon either way but maybe this will help lol,
This strain with the crazy news of next week about inflation its going to go down damn.,
Meme stocks probably should get bounced on the floor a little. They could earn a redemption story. People love throwing money at comebacks,
This post, like most other GME/AMC posts, isn't worth the electricity used to display it.,
Ok the last minute BS is on. First nobody already know if this variant make the vaccines less effective; in the worst case Biontech already told they can make vaccines for every possible variants. And stop this ridiculous theory that market going down is good for shorted stocks,
Covid is such bullshi. Can't wait to buy this dip too and have even more money in a year,
So. Be careful trying to get creative with any thesis involving negative beta.  Don't consider it a hedge that has a high probability of actually working.  If it complements your existing, working strategy that involves holding a position that would benefit from it, then feel free to include it as a minor point in favor of that holding, but realize that unless you have very specific knowledge of a large fund's holdings AND their strategy and responses to events you don't necessarily know that there is even a small chance of it working.,
No,
You should probably try to find at least one friend that isn't brain dead.,
Pfizer & Moderna announced they can rejig the existing vaccines to match the new variant within 6 weeks, if it's found to evade current vaccines. They can start shipping in 100 days.

This time around every gov is much more diligent, many started shutting down travel from Africa. Any businesses that survived have adapted to working with restrictions anyways, so the impact on existing business will be low, and given everyone's experience with the supply chain fuckery it's unlikely they will start shutting down orders, but most likely will continue stocking for when things reopen fully - should they have to shut down in any way.

All in all, even if this variant evades vaccines the trouble it can cause is far more limited than the original covid shit, and will be dealt with faster and better (you don't have a orange potato in office to begin with..).

Can it cause short-term damage? probably, but I don't expect we'll be seeing anything like a crash of March 2020 again.,
Holy shit this is stupid as fuck,
If gme goes up tomorrow.i will lick my own asshole,
🥱 same old shit not sure how people are still drinking that kool aid,
Scary to think about honestly. Are people still
Afraid of covid? I’m not sure the markets will tank again. Maybe a little but not like march 2020,
"GME is a negative beta and acts as a hedge" 
GME down 6%. 




Mmmhhhhhmmmmm keep telling yourself that,
It is going to be mild and the market will rally off the fake scare,
Negative beta my ass. It dropped 12% today.,
No OP you’re fucking retarded and negative beta won’t save your barely shorted stock.,
This market is unbelievable. Another covid strain and everyone shits their pants

When the fuck are we going to move on,
No one in here knows what a spike protein mutation is. Get your vaccine and trade the volatility.,
>1. GME, AMC, and other meme stocks have a negative beta and therefore serve as a hedge against falling markets

I think it's a spurious correlation. There's no reason to believe it will remain that way.

> These stocks remain heavily shorted, and therefore, funds that are stuck in egregious short positions have to buy to cover to get out, and potentially very quickly

Potentially, but maybe they can rest easier after today.

> B.1.1.529 'horrific' killer virus strain could induce this market catalyst (as unfortunate as that is to say that it came to this in order to have free and fair markets). Thoughts?

It will catalyse events one way or the other, but I don't see why it would make your predictions the ones to come true.,
I don't know how to say this in a nice way, but it has to be said... You're a fucking idiot.,
The January sneeze proved that collateral requirements mean nothing to the nscc. They are self-regulated/administered and they can use discretion as they see fit; I highly doubt collateral requirements cause moass. 

(GME)
1. I recall something about the negative beta being heavily skewed by the sneeze and not really being all that important of an indicator in this case
2. True. GME’s confirmed short-interest is a once in a lifetime chance for retail
3. They might use it as a story but the casino is derivative based and criminals are at the helm so its gonna be boom bust cycles. Not to say covid hasn’t done massive dmg to the global economy, i think globally it was ~7% contraction in 2020. With a confirmed lessening in quantitative easing (and rising inflation) +the 5th wave it makes a great narrative for the msm 

DRS is the catalyst GME moon soon,
Meme stocks as a hedge? Lmfao 😂🤣

You forgot the most likely scenario: hedgies closed their short position months ago and these meme stocks will only trend downwards as the market continues to dump,
No. Op is super stupid.,
Gme is heading back to 175$ not sure what stock you’re watching.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Lmao came here to read comments bashing OPs post/ideas. 

...Just found a buncha comments about sucking dick instead. Not that upset tbh,
GME and AMC aren't shorted like they used to be.  Beta is reflective of past performance not future, it's subject to change. If anything it's a good idea to short them if there's a crash.,
Why does every fucking event in the world need to be linked with GME and AMC?

Stop fucking thinking you’ll get another “squeeze” and get that retarded shit off of here.

I hope GME and AMC crash so hard they become under 1B$ market cap so the sub rules will prohibit discussion about these pieces of garbage,
No. I don't agree at all.,
Found the bagholder,
No, no, no, no. This doesn't work the way you guys wanna believe it works. Sorry. I know reality is disappointing. But I have to live with it, too.,
You can just keep your money in cash. It won't go up, but it won't go down either.,
Wrong place to post OP go back to your circle jerk sub,
LMAO...I love this Reddit man....

"horrific' killer virus strain (50 spike protein mutations)"...

followed by...

"So...short squeeze... right?",
1 the negative beta is due to the january spike. Try calculating it from february and you will discover a great truth...  
  
2 I see that gme has a short interest of 10%..  
  
3 Sure it could be a catalyst but not to get gme and amc to 10M per share -\_-''It could be a catalyst for all stocks and c r y p t o s as happened during the lockdown.,
Nah it’s just more BS to manipulate markets. That’s all it is.,
Meme stocks always end badly. Just a matter of when no?,
Data showing it is extremely efficient at transmission.  Double dosed Pfizer in South Korea was Asymptomatic.

Good news there if you are vaccinated that is good news. If unvaccinated uhhhhh,
Ryan Cohen has had an elaborate scheme of window-licking children in the ghettos of Alexandria.,
AMC and GME are down just enough for people to lose money, shorts to make money, but not increase any margin requirements.  Both down less then 5%….that’s not going to do anything.,
Closed out my GME short today, $240 cost basis, covered at $206. Can't complain.,
What's this COVID business, is it new? It must be a new thing, cause it's the first I've heard of it. There's no way it could have affected the market 2 years ago, because COVID surely wasn't a thing then, it's definitely a new thing I've never heard of before. Sounds scary.,
WTF are you talking about? Airlines are not shutting down travel! The hysterical xenophobe Biden has shut down travel between the US and 8 African countries, but everything else is as open as it was yesterday.,
**The short interest is ~10%** - No margin call will cause this stock to go anywhere but down.  


It doesn't matter though, if it doesn't you morons still scream manipulation.,
Just think

Fda green lights vax for kids!

2 days later,  new strain dangerous to kids…


Shits to fishy for me anymore,
This new strain sounds too shady for me

1. It's existence is still only potential
2. No actual proof of this strain effecting the vaccine any different than the current form.

This sounds like a huge bear trap, especially if this strain turns out to be nothing to worry about , What'd happen then? The stocks would just jump back up? It's just too ridiculous to bleed the market like that over theories.

Also about GME and AMC, these are not heavily shorted, they do not behave against the market anymore, quit deluding,
Here comes the unnecessary fiscal stimulus again,
Beta is a statistic, not a characteristic, fucking retard,
Get puts on airlines ?,
Calls or puts on VIX . Vix spiked,
Pre market -8%,
My AMC naked short calls expiring OTM.  Thanks y’all for the laughs.,
Yes - with next months inflation numbers we got dark times ahead,
It's not just going to affect meme stocks though.

Burry kicking himself now over TSLA.,
Now hear me out. As inflation heats up many governments around the world are worried about their future elections. With this in mind, they have been battling with OPEC to cut down oil prices but with to no avail, to say the least. 

2 Days ago all oil consuming countries agree to release some crude from their reserves to bring price down but it didn't bring down crude by much. And then a new variant is announced and vola! Crude collapsed by 12%.

I remember when Delta variant was announced there was hardly any dip in the market.,

Dutch bros. Not investment advise.,
was a bit worried for a min. expected worse tbh,
Market has been due for at least a 10-20% correction for awhile.  We are at unprecedented peaks.  Get in cash.  And if you don’t, have a stop loss……how much are you willing to lose?  10%?  20%?   Know what you are willing to lose, and be prepared.,
More virus means more lockdown means more money for big tech firms means the US market growing even more. 🤷🏽,
Travel, Leisure, Service all short you make a fortune it is not getting better. This mutation is awful. Spike protein mutation is not something to play with. With that many mutations better not call this COVID-19. It should be called COVID-21. I can’t pretend anymore this that I am immune with available Vaccines with this new type of Virus. I don’t know how Flu vaccine caused the depression and you still can have a rosy market with more a deadly form of virus. The spike in COVID in Germany and rest of Europe, was telling the story about “something is wrong”, I could smell the danger when new spike of cases was happening. Politicians always fool their people and hope things to go away by itself instead of tackling it heads on when, especially when it comes to viruses. Poor South Africans penalized just by bringing it up. They don’t have as many resources as NIH has, it is stupid if we think INH didn’t knew about this variant, but Africans did the heavy lifting, it is just unfair to treat them like that. This virus is circulating and find new ways to attack us. 
Travel ban is just to scare other nations from research and whistleblow other variants and this move is just political.,
My XOM put went ham this morning.,
WHO designated Omicron as a "Variant of Concern" this afternoon at the conclusion of their meeting:

[https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern)

&#x200B;

Wrote a DD about this if you're interested

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2t901/nu\_variant\_who\_catalyst\_spy\_yang/,
Lol gtfo this is just a gme ape disguising his conspiracy theories as an innocent question "uhh yeah so my friends talked about how this new virus could trigger something called the moass, not sure what that really is tbh but...  wen lambo?",
Gme and amc go down every time. I don’t know why y’all think differently,

Here.....sigh,
I just bought back in today so I hope you people will get it right this time,
$25,
In at $20 in January, still in now with 46% losses.,
Here...![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Our little tart held up pretty nice… there have been the technical spikes in GME and others of the basket, looks like BaBerry wants its bass solo!,
Bought more shares and calls today.  IN HUGELY ;)

IF the Apes can come in will be recruiting friends into this.  MOONSHOT!,
I’ve been doing fairly decent at BB options, the stock is pretty predictable. This after I got greedy and lost my ass in the big meme stock run up 2020.,
Still here. Still in it to win it.,
Loaded up on 12/3 $10C,
2200 @ $18,
Bought @19, immediate crash,
🍇📈,
I bought in $8k for u fucking apes so let’s go…,
UP UP UP!!!,
500 @ 11.37. Sell calls monthly.,
I still feel hurtig by -40% ... but as an retard I spend my Christmas money on BB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Let’s goooooo,
Prezent,
Bought the dip. Got that average down more.,
had like 4k worth at $16 I'm gonna be here a while,
Hi!
2000 at $15 cost basis $10

Selling 5 CSP at $10,
$BB wake up call for those that doubt this play this week. So easy to pressure shorts above $10.50 since they are playing that head and shoulders on the daily. Too bad it's an inverse head and shoulders about to print on the weekly. This is gonna be a great bullish win watch.,
Hi,
come save me at $15, thanks!,
Let's go BB.,
Hooo fuck ya bud. I bought in after the craze, under 9.

Hang in there bag holders. She’ll come up.,
Steady drop to 9 range.. hopefully the rest of my buy orders hit. XXX long af ~ 10.4,
Please tell me this is all house money and you managed to at least cover your cost basis when it spiked for a second time to the $18 range like I did?,
Come on BB wtf are you waiting for? These bags are heavy! Been holding since March!,
$12 gang and now feeling decent about it having read all of your comments…,
Down 37% with 3000 shares. F.,
Stilll holding fffffffack,
[removed],
Still the third biggest meme stock after GME and AMC which has not mooned yet.,
600 shares at @16.50, still holding,
Painful af still holding adding since January though,
Fuck bb and ceo & management…this stock just keep screwing us over and over just straight garbage,

Nah, my 420P's are for Dec8.  They were only meant to be my monthly hedge against the market tanking, but they're up 333% now, so 🤷🏻‍♂️.,
They are some rich retards I'll tell you those are trading for .47 now,
Depending on when they bought, they might have just 5X their money.  Going for .53 each now. 

Neat.,
Prophet,
Its Michael burry lol,
I'd bet they end up printing in some miracle market crash,
Seems legit lmao,
Open interest 122,
Probably a fund balancing their slippage exposure,
Looks like there's 30008 retards. Maybe they know something man!!!,
My bad…,
look at the 415's OI, someone was probably just closing out a long dated spread,
OI is 122..,
Probably Nancy peloski and she’s always right so you better get your puts in order!!,
Obviously, it was the latest COVID variant that bought those puts. 😜,
Sir that’s just CNBC,
I like your style gay bear with a smoke problem!,
Nice,
I've had 430s for may that I caned out today,
🥸,
Nancy Pelosi,
Excuse me ☝️ Sir, Guilty as charged,
500call? jan 21 2022 ... boutta run it in my paper acct,
Soon to be broke retard,
Nancy??? Is that u,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Call me an idiot but puts are an option to sell at $420.  SPY is current about $458.  Why sell at $420 when you can sell at $458?  Why are these ITM?

I don’t do options obviously.,
That banner ad goes so well with it ~ it's a True Crime to be holding those...lol,
Me…and fuck off. It could happen.,

Heyyy.... this bear suit does not smell too bad.,
$6.9k gain. 

Congrats you naughty bear 🌈,
You motherfucker. All Fridays without a miss. Congrats but also fuck you because it wasn’t 0dte,
Based on your post history, you always make huge gains. But i wonder why you only put small money? Are you just gambling everytime you open your position and post it only when it works out?,
Bro.,
Great play,

The vertical I had to roll out today hates you for your success.

 It congratulations on your success.,
I made a bit over 200% on ZM puts.  Nov 26 @ 200. Sold around $200.,
Closed short leg (Nov 220p) this morning on the spike, closed long leg (Jan 220p) at the end of the day.,
i’m happy I cashed out my puts before earnings lol,
Nice! This was pretty obvious  just hard to execute. Good job!!,
how the fuck you sold this morning.. 220puts are worthless zm rally.. 

ban ... fake,

Somehow when you do a bunch of serious DD and still end up with the wrong answer, it stings in a worse way than just YOLOing your cash based off some half baked thesis on WSB,
Me: 250% profit last two weeks.
Me Friday:-80% loss

Ohh. That's how math works....,
Cool is relative,
I just be retarded. My trades always hit me in the nuts instead.,
Notice how the new trader's graph rises. While the experienced trader peaked early and then held all the way to the bottom,
When I was a new trader I would lose money. Then I found WSB and now I lose money faster.,

This is when you take profit and the rug pulled on house money.  Lmao,
New trader, accepts immediate loss. Experienced trader “averages” down.,
I remember when one of my stocks beat expectations by 300% and the stock dropped 5%. Like WTF?,
I don’t know why this hit me so hard. Laugh crying right now. Respect,
varial heelflip?,
This is so awesome!!!

i just strategically retreated from the stock market this week, i'm going in on the next dip, it's gonna hit hard this winter, i'm guessing mid january the stock market will collapse.,

Losing with style. YOLO for the win🦍🦍🦍,
Don’t feel bad you are not alone 
The market is designed for retail to loose and they/con artists to win,
Quite accurate,
That💥to the face means the portfolio went straight up!,
If you’re gonna blow up your portfolio, at least do it in style with finesse.,
He's riding my calls portfolio lol,
Sick air,

[Wallstreetbets trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRq1Ksh-32g),
You can tell that he is experienced because he is traveling down the graph,
TIL Andrew Reynolds is an experienced trader,
As a new trader, like brand new, what is the best platform to use? I know we don't like Robin hood anymore, right?,
Jesus. This is too accurate,
Dump 1000 dollars

Get scared by the news

Sell for 20 dollars profit,
If its done with style even a fail deserves pussy,

Now this!,
..yeah that was me today trading villagers in Animal Crossing.. i got scammed.,
Made me lol.,
Sums it up pretty well,
Old. but gold. Never fails to get a laugh out of me.,
Lol,
I think i should become a communist revolutionary,
Which one are we again?,
Happened with amc where i buy stock for 16 dollars for 150$.

Then next 2 day it went to 5-7 dollars.

Then bought again stocks at 8$ for 150$.,
[removed],
All of my stock picks based on dd seriously outpreformed all the indexes this year but since im a retard and bought weeklies i lost thousands,
See we know the loss porn is inevitable, but really it's all about the style points.,
I’m still in the green on my stonks—amateur boglehead here,
I swear to God. I bout 50 shares of newegg at 16.50. Rode it till it finally hit 19 again. BOOM it hit 22. FML,
Just takes a little longer to get fucked that's all,
this need more upvotes,
New trader: standing on a skateboard

Experienced trader: Impossible flip,
How does this shit get upvoted?

So lame, re-used, basic ass meme,

The stores didn't look anymore packed than usual. Then again, covid made it more convenient to shop from home on the internet. We are slammed at UPS and today was only just the first official day of peak season. I can already tell it's gonna be very heavy this year. The Black Friday internet sales will hit us Monday and Tuesday and its likely to be devastating. Will let you know,
Was a bigger deal at the dispensary than any store here in Colorado, I was on the road all day went to two gamestops no series x gave up and hit the weed discounts like everyone else.,
I made the hospital busy by getting my appendix out. Saved tons of money not shopping 10/10.,
👀 none of this will matter until the numbers for Black Friday, and cyber Monday are released from the perspective of the major credit/debit card companies…. That will be the real evidence you need,
Non existent..,
Maryland… People were parked on sidewalks… it was busy…,
Just looked like an average weekend. But on a Friday. Lol,
Weak AF.,
There were barely even sales this year. $5 off, $10 off $500 purchases- who gives a fuck? I bought all of my gifts already because I was worried about a shortage and on $2500 worth of purchases I didn’t see a single thing I would have saved on. Corporations have lost their fucking minds,
lol at stores everyone buys online. Home Depot was pretty packed,
went to a major market for reasons not at all related to Xmas or Black Friday. I looked around about 1/2 way through it and went “damn, this doesn’t feel like a Black Friday”,
It's weird but I find electronics that I normally would want during black Friday are priced better all year long so I don't wait for this sale like I once did,
Chaos in DFW,
Weak.  Very weak,
Oh yeah I totally forgot existed, no one talked about it,
I never left the house today. I did snag 2 king comforters for a total of $44 at Macys.com though.,
People go to the store on Black Friday because of the deals… there are less deals… no one is trying to leave there house just to stop for sticker price.,
Eh.....I stayed in. No idea.,
Roads were clear didn’t go anywhere,
What's with people going to stores. I have stores come to me (thru online shopping). Peasants...,
I run a small business. Weak as usual. Fingers crossed small business Saturday comes through for us.,
Shit, only know 1 person that went and wasted money,
Nobody bought anything around here, it was just smash and grabs,
Bless this post. Pure autism in its natural state.

OP visits multiple malls in order to watch people while they shop.

OP decides to crowd source his idea, not realizing they are just creating autists staring at other autists... while people around them go about their ways shopping.,
Bay area valley fair, almost non existent. I'd do the same if I was under the fear of getting robbed.

There's talks they're not going after just stores anymore, but the people as well.,
Longest line I saw was for returns. Shit ton of merch everywhere. And I still bought nothing! Bwahaha!!!,
It’s all about Amazon and the online shopping.,
I think what is going to happen is a whole lot of people like me are buying things online rather then in store. Why would I want to go out and holiday shop in the store with 300 other people and stand in long lines that are beyond stupid.,
Ohio - there was a line outside an old record store at like 7am. No one goes there. Lot of traffic at the mall. I just saw as i drove by. Nothing crazy.,
It was NUTS in south Florida!,
Same old same,
I don't know but in northeast was busy. It seems people will be in even more debt after this Black Friday.,
Uhhhh....everything can be bought online.  Free shipping .,
New york was poppin,
Central Florida was less busy than a typical Wednesday morning lol,
I completely forgot lol,
Evening outlet is fully crowded, witnessed.

[Black Friday loses some luster as shoppers turn out to hunt scarce deals](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/black-friday-2021-live-updates-latest-news-sales-and-deals.html)

Mall staples Express and Calvin Klein owner PVH ended the day down 7%. Department store chain Dillard’s was down 6%, and Macy’s fell 5%. Coach owner Tapestry and U.S. mall owner Simon Property Group were also down 5% by the end of trading. While American Eagle, Ralph Lauren and Under Armour all closed Friday down around 4%.

Holiday sales are expected to climb at a record pace this year, with the National Retail Federation predicting an increase of between 8.5% and 10.5%. That would put sales during November and December at $843.4 billion and $859 billion.  


[Black Friday sales up 12.1% year over year, according to early data from Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/black-friday-2021-live-updates-latest-news-sales-and-deals.html#106980899-A-l1shm9T),
I work for a small to mid size retailer and I can tell you we broke records both online and in store by mid day.... Looks like a strong season.,
I saw lines of people outside several retailers today around 6pm in a shopping plaza I went to. Best Buy had about 60 people waiting to get inside while I was picking up an online order. However, was this simply due to some sort of Covid protocol the stores enacted in my area for Covid related capacity? I have no idea. I’m sort of the same camp as many others - lots of people just shifted to online. One thing I will say is the item sales discounts were pretty weak for anything I was interested in so maybe margins will be better even if sales aren’t.,
The market gave me a red dildo surprise u/GreenDildoSurprise,
Busy in ne Ohio but it’s so hard to tell as many people shop online more now of days!,
There was an article that apple might sell 10M phones this weekend, if so thats amazing and there is incredible pent up demand.,
Lots of handies behind the Wendy's. Half off and buy two get one free.,
King of Prussia mall crazy packed,
Compare traffic to discounts, it’s a wash man,
I just want a fucking PS5 like millions of others. 

No supply, no shopping.,
Slow but it could be any more of factors from black Friday fatigue, lockdown laziness,  online shopping and many places not offering better deals than normal,
In SoCal, not that busy, typical Friday,
Why even go there anymore?   They used to have $100 TVs and shit and you had to waste hours to get one.  Click, free delivery.  No contest.,
Short retailers and payment processors. Long COIN and HOOD.,
Non-existence, Honolulu,
I bought rollerblades at the store. It was medium busy. Kids are more concerned with non physical assets, digital hype is not to be reckoned with. I like to stimulate the economy. I buy retail, I overtip, and I also make a fuck ton of money each year in the market but what do I know?,
Stores in my area didn't even do black Friday. Walmart, Target and Home depot just ran "black Friday sales" all week long. So basically no doorbusters or anything like that.,
Never been to a Black Friday. Keeping the streak alive,
Considering I started getting “bLaCk FrIdAy StArTs NoW!!!1one” emails two weeks ago, I think a lot of people were confused AF. 

The only reason Black Friday is a thing to me is because my family would kinda gear up for it when I was little. If you are a newly minted adult out to spend some of your first real money on Christmas gifts, I think this year would be a confusing one.,
Best buy and all their tvs this year.....I thought there was a chip shortage.,
I would say overall the madness that was Black Friday has been dying out for a long time. Especially with cyber Monday is a thing. You can just buy everything online on either day. COVID doesn’t help either, but at this rate I’m sure this will become the norm,
Really weak this year,
I live near the biggest mall in my state, it's been busy all November, black Friday seemed consistent. I don't think black Friday is really a thing anymore and shouldn't be used as a metric. Everybody knows the deals are fake or not good and so many people prefer online shopping.,
I have a family member who works at Walmart she told me they were already slammed with online orders the day ahead of Thanksgiving.  Not sure when the #’s will come out for cyber Monday.  Was looking at plays on Etsy, V, PYPL, maybe FedEx, UPS.  Be interesting to see how the market trades on Monday with a full day.  I’ve been in the 🌈🐻camp for most of the recent rally just based on all the gap ups and valuations.  Could we see a 10-20%  correction sometime next year sure, but I’m increasingly in the camp of a total crash seems unlikely.  Way too many people myself included would btfd.  Lots of stuff already sitting at or near 52 week lows.  I think the market would actually respond better to a rapid correction rather than a slow and steady decline all of next year.  The latest RONA thing was just an excuse to sell.  I’m not an anti vax or anything but people are over it.  Real risk is point of origin countries get hammered again by Covid.,
Stores around me were empty. But I did use Amazon and Etsy to do 99% of my shopping this year - I assume others did the same.,
Nothing was different, nobody has money to spend on this dumb shit,
People learned that you can order online,
Went to a mall in Belgium, lots of black Friday deals and shopping going on. Thinking people want to get out and shop before omicron sparks the another lockdown. But the US has better infrastructure (delivery speed, return policies, credit cards, no VAT) for online shopping, so buying habits being equal, I assume the US is seeing a lot more online orders.,
I accidently went shopping in dutch "black friday" it was busy but the prices didnt change,
Massive crime waves didn’t help,
Calls on AMZN?,
I didn't personally do any, all the advertised sales looked like marked up prices only brought down to normal via "sales", wtf.,
Citadel outlet in Los Angeles jammed up about 3 blocks in line just to get into the parking lot, also caused #5 freeway traffic for 2 days straight,
I think marketplace on NPR just had an episode on this topic. It's expected to be a great holiday season, up 10% compared to last year. With the supply chain issues, expect significantly less "deals" as strong demand and low supply will make it a sellers market. Could explain why the black friday deals didn't feel very juicy this year.,

Over and over again the dumbest fucking thing I have ever seen. And I don’t know shit,  so imagine how dumb some of the shit that’s out there,
“$125 Call”,
Shit would’ve had to rocket out of the Milky Way Galaxy, this wasn’t an investment but a donation.,
$125 lmao,
Theta gang says thank you for the free cash,
Yikes.  Kind of a lot of money for something that would have to moon soon to pay off.,
You people are truly dumb,
I thought I was fucking retarded,
Still got some time, mine expire next week. Although i only grabbed 1. Options are shiny and tempting but need to resist....,
Why would you spend that much on out of the money calls? Retard,
At least you've got 24K to lose imagine being poor and not having had that.,
I sold you those lmao,
Imagine putting $25k into calls and not understanding options…AT ALL. Dude you were just asking the other day what IV is. Stay away from options!,
If you're willing to lose this much let me send you my Venmo so you just send me a few thousand.,
I actually had to do a double take on that strike price. I cannot believe someone would be so naive.,
At least the shit I'm down bigly has a chance of coming back. But AMC? op why?!,
The funny thing is that this was bought in July so OP fully expected AMC to hit $125 by December as if it was a logical and safe bet,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Fallen ape,
Thought that said AMD for a sec. You would've been in the $$$ right now,
This is the really dumb shit I come here for. 

Who the fuck is even still paying $0.31 for these?,
I didn’t sell at 70 & this is really fucking dumb,
Market makers made an absolute killing of retards who loaded up on far OTM expensive options like you did.. They love us retard retailers who don't give a fuck about 'price' or 'value'. The fact they were able to sell $125 calls for $5 is incredible.,
So let me get this straight. You, fellow moron, threw $25k at the chance that AMC will move x5? But then, you wanted expert mode so you gave the $25k a short expiration date? Well done soldier, I’m shocked this was the outcome!,
If my grandmother who passed away many a years ago understood this she would be like: Oh no sweetheart - give u a hug - tell you u are special - and then tell your dad to set up an intervention where some stranger wakes you up in the middle of the night and the next thing you know your in fat camp,
Start pumping now!!! You still got three weeks.....yeah that was a risky gamble dude, with a shit ton of money I might add....would be for me anyways.,
If you wait till 12/17 to sell you might have enough money to buy popcorn with your No Way Home tickets.,
Makes me feel not so bad for my £1750 loss over about two years 💀😭,
So these are the retards who help fund hedge funds.,
just wait for two more years to get to that 125…. Jesus.. you belong here,
You’ve still got a couple weeks to post your “DD” on why ~~GME~~ AMC is such a great stock. Still fucked, but you can at least take some fellow retards down with you.,
I was wondering who I was selling those to.

Have sold several Dec 17 125C to 145C prior to AMC's earnings and sleep like a baby

How on earth did you pay $580 for those contracts though? God damn a honda civic worth of 300% OTM AMC calls

Ironic thing is they actually moved up 3-5% today,
Never go ape

AMC and gme are poison,
Congratulations on being an ape,
You deserve that after buying a 125 call what the fuck,
FJB LETS GO BRANDON,
Wow.,
Oof,
Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn..,
There’s still time!,
merry christmas,
I wish I was this retarded with this much money to waste on retarded things,
Fack,
I swear I thought this said AFRM and i was so confused,
I thought it said AMD and was like how the fuck did you do that?,
That's one hell of a bullish investor,
How far can you carry forward capital losses? Asking for OP,
Exercise them all!,
WTF were you drinking?,
So....now just do the opposite and you will be making $$!,
No. Please explain the logic behind that call. 😊,
I think I might buy some amc just for the CC selling opportunities,
No taxes at least,
OP you might want to save that last $1300,
Actually fucking retarded.,
I like you. Let's be friends,
Bruh… $125?

That’s optimistic.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Hey! I only lost $16k in the last two trading days.  You… make me feel… better?,
I am trying to think of bigger wastes of money but I honestly can't. Like, even burning that shit in a fire pit Escobar style would be more fun than doing this..,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
Would you have made a profit if you sold during the September run up?,
Anyone hating here is a wish bag holder,
Go big AND go home.,
This makes me feel better about my positions.. I may be retarded but not this retarded,
Should’ve bought shares,
Looks like my TSLA calls that expired today.  Lol,
Diamond ape hands = empty account.  Sincerely, your fellow ape,
You gave your $25K away on a silver platter,
Honestly back on July 13 this was a very feasible play. We all thought AMC would’ve squeezed by 12/17. I to lost a lot on options, now I buy stock on dips and hold and only buy barley out of the money and give it at least a couple months to hit,
This is what happens when you are in a cult lol. These people still think it can hit $1000 a share.,
If you wanted to spend this much on OTM calls go 2 years out on expiration. I mean fuck it right?,
Were you high when you bought those calls?,
Are you actually retarded? Like seriously,
Good god this sub is such a blessing,
May aswell have just flushed your fucking money down the toilet lmao. AMC $125 calls, one of the most retarded plays I’ve seen,
Buy top, sell bot🔥👌🏻,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Dam bro should of first stuck you toes in the water before you went all in,
it's not even the question of "WHY" but "WTF?!?",
If you tell the memers that there will be no MOASS, prepare to be banned from their subs.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
You are fine you still have 3 weeks.. this whole market crash and meme stonk boom will be over before than.. delta variant didnt crash the market... no reason this new variamt should... dont read between the lines because lines suck, the real message today is Liquidation... some hedgefunds have gone belly up and the fun has just begun..


I challenge anyone to prove me wrong buy puts or short the stock you hold your options in and hokd their position past December 17th..  

I bet you wont.,

How did you know?  Are you the Prince of Nigeria?,
Great for you! I also have a bntx position that's up 400% a march 2022 240c i wish i bought more,
I knew I’d see this one. My dumbass didn’t have the nuts to pick up some calls on the dip at the start of the month. 

Grats and fuck you!,
Why is todays return bigger than total return? Were you down 300%?,
good work, Im holding a contract too brother,
Up 1200% on my 15/12 450c, but holding over the weekend. This is gonna go parabolic next week. Last week was just a small taste of the tendies to come.,
It's too early to sell! My new price-target because off OMICRON is now 650$. Remember tripple witching day is coming. BNTX is now a parabolic trapped long. I bought it at 5th of November at 210$![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),

I’ll be very surprised if this variant isn’t already in the US,
It’s about time for a new variant , the last new variant was about 6 months ago . So we were due !,
Whatever your political ideology, this is so obviously and universally bad if these countries & continents are going to go back into lockdown.,
Bunker time! Wake me when Terry Crews is President! #Comacho2024,
Racist and xenophobic…right?,
Trump did it to china, *he's a racist*

Biden did it to SA, *silence*

Short SA.,
👀 asking for a friend but is this considered racist? Kinda like the China ban lol,
This has more variants than a shitty comic book,
The idea that travel to and from Africa was ever allowed to restart is mind boggling,,
Sitting on a mound of cash so I’m ready for the discounted stocks,
I hope it shows up in my office building where all the supervisors decided to force us all back into the office 5 days a week.,
Sheeeesh,
Not like I was planning on traveling to South Africa. 

Musk and Sharlto Copley are the only things from South Africa we need anyways.,
Christ. Cant lockdown forever.,
These seven African countries have the lowest impact in America. One China restriction would have done so much already.,

> WASHINGTON - The United States will restrict travel for non-U.S. citizens from South Africa and seven other countries starting on Monday, part of a global effort to stem the spread of the heavily mutated omicron variant of Covid-19, according to senior Biden administration officials.

> Health experts are deeply concerned about the transmissibility of the omicron variant given that it has an unusual constellation of mutations and a profile that is different from other variants of concern.

> It is feared a sharp upswing of Covid cases in South Africa&#039;s Gauteng province - where the heavily mutated strain of the virus was first identified - could mean it has greater potential to escape prior immunity than other variants.

Yoooooolo. 6969 shares. It makes sense. SNDL.,
I’m pretty excited for the buy back hope they legalize pot I only got 100 shares,

If you want marijuana exposure, why this garbage company? There are so many better ones,

My imaginary put will print tomorrow.,
Black Friday. It’s on sale.,
Red Friday. Awesome. RIP my portfolio for 2021,
Whatever. Powell pumped us right through 2020; he'll save us in 2022 as well. All in SPY & QQQ. Perhaps even TQQQ.,
The vuvuzela variant,
All that stronger dollar bs news was making it seem that JPow will start turning off the printer

News like this about new variants and shit is the perfect excuse for JPow to keep going balls deep on that printer.,
How the heck does visual mod even work.. is it going to molest me?,
400 points is hardly a plunge. It like 1%.,
Didn’t South Africa already get a variant?,
Wait,  you mean interest rates will plummet?  And Powell will have more excuse to keep pumping?.  Okay,
Why do these headlines always link completely random stories to price movements?

"SP500 up 1% on news about possible OutKast reunion". This is how this sounds like.,
Discount stocks on black friday? Dont mind if I do,
Calls on naming the next variant.

Covid thunder gun 2: electric boogaloo,
I need a 10k stimmy today!!!,
It's funny but in 12 hours spy will be green. Too many puts will go itm if drops below 467. Mm's will prop spy up after a drop. For those who trade spy if we get the drop at open get ready for fd calls that will print.,
As much as I hate COVID, it has been amazing for business...,
Red in the morning; Green by 11.30 - tech stocks roar back 👍🚀🚀🚀,
Can we please get an asteroid too?,
Wakanda forever! Yibambe! Yibambe![ Yibambe!](https://youtu.be/kIA3hSfIrao),
People still sell on COVID news?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
When Ameribra's wake up this shit will be green again.. Didn't Asia/Europoors learn that stonks actually GO UP during a pandemic - this will be just another excuse for FED and JPOW to print even harder and delay any rate hikes until the year 2030. Stonks go up - buy the dip.,
Fuck yes! I hope they extend my remote work.,
FUCK MY LIFE,
SO MY BEARISH SPREAD HAS A CHANCE!!!!!! PLEASE JESUS GIMME THEm SWEET TENDIES.,
Lol watch it all rebound as we approach open,
Same thing happened with Delta, buy the dip!!!!,
covid 5.0,
PTON gonna come back up on dat ass. Stay at home here we go.,
I can do with one more year of WFH.,
Oh for fuck sake. Again?! I’m tired of corona virus man.,
The desperation and coping in here is insane,
Tomorrow is not a legit trading day yawn,
more buying opportunities,
Powell:  Variants will keep inflation in check well into 2023.  We will start raising rates well into the spring of 2023.  Thank you.,
Dow down over 700 now,
There will always be new variations! It’s a fuking coronavirus! Flu changes every year! This will never end,
Buy the dip !!! ;)),
Oh no. Not a new variant. Fear porn. More contagious less deadly as variants mutate just like every other respiratory virus. Buy dips get rich,
OH GOD OH JESUS OH FUCK OH CHRIST. 

I got 35 years left to retire if I don’t shoot my dick off and sob into a McRib until I bleed out first. Unless this is significantly more deadly, masks and social distancing plus existing vaccines are just going to have to do. 

I guarantee you it’s being sequenced, and someone is starting to investigate the likelihood of creating an updated vaccine for a future booster shot. 

We are slowly building a global observation system to track and assess this shit. It’s going to be years before it’s ahead of the curve, but the healthcare experts aren’t at home jerking off into one McRib while wiping their tears with another like you and I. 

Source: family in public health research. They hate their lives right now, but aren’t panicking until more information is available.

Edit: also, I’m shitfaced. Don’t listen to me.,
Black Swan Friday would be so great for discounts.,
Ahhh It's gonna be glorious tomorrow, don't think ill be able to sleep from all the excitement lol,
Well....apparently it's vacine resistant so...we are fucked ?


As long as pltr is green I'm good.,
Really? New variant my ass.  How bout evergrande situation in china?,
I feel like we’ve heard this one.

Reality is MMs are going to rug pull profit and then buy the diiiiippppss

Plus metaverse and NVIDIA and Tesla don’t give a fuck about viruses,
Fear mongering.,
CNBC pushing the market down hard over 
bullshit,
*rolls eyes* 

BTFD,
Load up on: PFE, BNTX, MDRN, NVAX etc,
ZM, maybe a recovery here?,
Yawn,
My calls will print when it turns out it’s another bs scheme to ban tobacco, alcohol, hot food and…. shoes….yeah that actually happened.,
For fucks sake,
These are the days that I’m glad I’m sitting in over half cash.


# #BlackFridaySale,
Now people will jump on pelaton even though everyone who would buy into them already has and zoom, even though most people who would work from home already do.  Yet I can see everyone dumping supermarket stocks, who make an absolute killing, bank stocks when their profits aren't affected.

Oh and let's get real.  77 cases with no deaths.  That's what this variant is.  Not two years ago when we couldn't track a disease, but now when we can track almost everyone and countries have already red listed those countries.  This is a non starter.,
Why doesn’t it even go down at this point? We honestly don’t care how many variants they make up to manipulate the market and the masses,
Time to say “screw it,” we aren’t shutting down peoples lives for this stuff anymore. Whatever we are doing obviously isn’t working. Already spent in a year more than we did all of WWII in adjusted $$. Not trying to downplay the threat (fully vaccinated here). Just realizing that the world can’t afford to continue to shut everything down.,
Green at the open idiots!,
Mmmmm hope rates puke as well. Need me some of that tasty tasty free monies.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Stay at home stock? Pton Tdoc?,
Buy the dip, got it!,
Get ready for red Friday,
I just want the final version of COVID to come already. The one that kills in 15 minutes after infection and it’s sudden.,
Damn it, just as my portfolio had turned green !,
Already prices in, we gonna bounce when market opens,
It’s down like 900 points now lol,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) jpoww's printer ink ordered in bulk from who? Kodak?,
The media should be ashamed for even putting out a headline as ridiculous as this.  They could blamed it on CEOs needing to cash out for their new private Black Friday sale.,
Lol these people are insane.  Who the fuck cares anymore.,
I always wanted a remake of 2020, not gonna miss this one. Split cash in ten, i buy each of next 10 dips,
Smells like fear; with a dash of manipulation,
I want the variant that is mixed with explosive diarrhea. You know… for shits and giggles 😀,
No one wants to be holding shit over the weekend.,
There I fixed it

Dow futures plunge 400 points amid fears of new government lockdowns. Politicians are not worried however they know exactly when to sell.,
This smells like BS. There was a Covid variant in South Africa a while ago that the vaccine didn’t help against. Is this the same thing? People are so scared now all “variant” is the new trigger word.,
And Chinese stock delistings,
Clickbait article. Nice farm attempt tho.,
Can’t wait to buy this dip.,

Black Friday discunt,
If Futures are already down 400 points on fear stemming from 6 confirmed cases in South Africa and 1 in Hong Kong, then I don't want to know what it will be down during the day as more cases are reported.,
Palantir can help. LOL,
Tech should see a bounce back from the correction this week,
Just seems extra sus that the delta variant basically ripped through India (before it got anywhere else) and people barely batted an eye. But a few news articles drop and some countries get banned and the global markets dump a few percent.,
As a South African on black Friday I will be buying at the nice discounted price, ez stonks.,
using the dow is retarded already. But using the dow in points instead of % is the retarded cherry on top of the retarded cake.,
The Street creating drama over little known outbreak on a half day of thin trading. OIL down 6%? Those $80C's might look tempting today for a bounce back bet.,
Welcome back! Peloton 😈,
Massive overreaction. Great buying opportunities,
Great! Another perfect time to buy and my stupid ass don't have the cash to buy.,
Btfd,
Why are people worried about another Covid variant? There’s like 5 already and everything is open. Not to mention if it’s coming from South Africa it’s a place where healthcare isn’t top notch line Western countries, it’s probably fine,
Black Friday deals!!,
TIME TO BUY BUY BUY BUY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957),
Correction— market down because hedge funds harvesting their crops and we need to provide a reason other than the truth.,
This post hasnt aged well, it 1000 points,
Black Friday discount for everyone! Seriously I doubt this variant will be that concerning. So far no variants have been able to break vaccines and none of them are much deadlier than the original strain. Get your friends vaccinated and there will be no lockdown and stonks will go up.,
Bull shit. #survivalofthefittest,
Oh no... anyway.,
Remember, do the opposite of whats being reported,
I learned my lesson over the past two years. If it's March 2020 all over again, buy the dip.,
I honestly don’t believe this is the reason the market is down.,
Is it Monday yet?,
Same shit during delta variant. Just hold.,
We know more about covid than we did in march 2020 and we have vaccines
The march 2020 « crash » was like what…3 days and the the market bounced back stronger than it was. I aint too worried.
(Well im worried cause i am at -28% overall but its not because of the market…. Just cause im dumb),
The world will continue to have COVID & mutations as long as we continue to push that vaccine garbage 😠,
Ahhhh! A flu-like viru!! Ahhhh! Shut everything down, we’re all gonna die!!,
The dip lol,
This is a very sad commentary for investors.  If people go nuts every time there is a new variant or someone dies of covid what does that say about the level of intelligence of investors? They are no better than molecules colliding in boiling water.,
Yay Black friday even stocks are on sale,
Couldn't possibly be terrible money management.,
Got a Pfizer call do y’all think it’s a hodl?,
Lmao what a bunch of Morons,
Just short the vix. All will be wonderful,
The fuck is this headline. Markets didn’t give single fuck about Covid-19 for almost two years. So, why the fuck will it matter now.,
They have to keep the fear mongering going to keep taking away your rights in the name of safety. While the elite ignore their own mandates. Rules for thee but not for me.,
[removed],
Gonna be a giant overreaction unless it turns out the new variant was much more deadly. Something tells me if that was the case, the news would be mentioning it, but they aren't... so there's that.,
Warnings have been there. This variant will do what the original one didn't do. Be prepared to say good bye to some people.,
These clowns will never let covid go.

Maybe when we're on wave 8,675 and the media is still trying to push humanity turning into 28 Weeks Later unless we continue to wear useless masks, the general populous will wake the f up.,
Bro this one isn't funny, its a god damn infectious monster. 1% to 30% positivity in a week in south africa, and it was airborne at a hotel in Hong Kong.

Spy puts baby.,
Oh my godddddd.  When the fck are we gonna let this stop running the way we live our lives?  It is here, not going anywhere...let's all go back to work, yea?  Fck sakes,
But but but I thought Biden was going to get rid of Covid,
how are you guys not board of covid yet?,
It’s v resistant. Translation, they never worked in the first place now they can save face. I don’t believe their lies but they want a market crash. I’ll be buying the dip.,
Oh no another covid variant thats harmless for >99% of people,
Jesus Christ did all you people come from The Donald?,
The vax has told people's immune systems the bad guy is some ginger dude. That ginger dude just put on some high hills, a dress, and a blonde wig.  And now that ginger dude is about to go drag queen story time on the fools who took the death shots.,

Oh sorry that the S&P!!emote:free\_emotes\_pack:stuck\_out\_tongue,
PFE and other bio stocks because they will keep churning it out..,
Bears still fukt,
Guess there really is gonna be a black friday sale LOLLLL,
F#@!,
We fukd,
I expect that after Christmas we will have a big sell-off. Banks are leveraged tits up (CFG, TFC) With current inflation customer deposits will decrease. Banks will be forced to sell their marketable securities. Leveraged hedgies will have to answer calls from Margin cunt, thus withdrawing their bank deposits. And the loop repeats. End of the capitalism. We need Lenin.,
Only 400???? Damn.i got alot of cash on the sidelines...lets see a 50 percent dump like trump .,
We have no idea if it’s even *that* transmissible. It’s mainly been circulating in the young, yet to see if more/less deadly in the old. Could be fine. Could be denial.,
There goes my SPY call. I really was hoping SPY can close out in the green after Thanksgiving,
Yeah, I think this will be green if not evens by the end of the day once all the Thanksgiving money buys the dip.,
Finally a dip,
My account is gone,
Anyone want to post that covid circle thing again? Its time,
Everything I own, just gets bogged, in the end.,
Wtf,
Fuck me, I bought moderna puts earlier this week,
Stocks on Sale boys!!! Buy them up!!! Looks like I’ll be adding some more NVDA in the morning!!!,
It’s the one from South Park “Covid 19 Delta Variant Plus Customer Rewards”,
of course after I sell my spy puts...,
I read that futures are fake and gay,
The wizard is no there ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735), we are fucked ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
950 and 400 for Nasdik at one point, there will be blood, from foreskin munchers hopefully hahahhh,
Zoom zoom,
Bend over because we are all going to get torn a new one,
Fears? It’s got carbon fibre legs, a 9mm and it can see through doors. World is proper fucked.,
time to buy!nn,
Spy just drill another 15 dollars so I can get better call entries 👀,
Im already down 60%+ on everything  except GME, whats a few more percentagw points,
dumbass global poors with the paperhands.  

when the US equities BTFD bros wake up, its gonna be carnage for bears.  again.,
I just got my salary today and my portfolio is mostly cash. Not gonna do anything today tho. But on Monday i most likely gonna buy something.,

buying shares of Alec Baldwin was a huge mistake.,
Now this is a discord I’ll pay for,
Like alec baldwin,
Only down 50%??  I only take advice from AT LEAST 75% losers,
I'll take bad choices for $1000 Alec.,
You realize you would have to make back 100% on both plays to break even right?,
Why hide the first one?,
Give me your best bet. I will take the other side!,
The advice here is to short anything u buy,
Tell us your investing strategy so we can take the opposite side of the trade and be up 50% (shhh! yes, i know! some will be triggered by the 50%, just dont mention it, remember which subreddit you are on),
well tour doing better than me,
50% is a dip. Hmu when u get delisted.,
ME.

MeMeMeMeMeMe. \*raises and waving my hand like a disturbed karen\*

PICK MEEEEEE!,
Yup investment advice, you tell us what your investing in and we do the opposite, sounds like a win,
50 is looking better than me!!,
Make it back with BB.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Prefer WSB Dating Advice from retards for retards.,
What are you buying next? I'll sell it to you.,
Oh man. Looks like the real price really is coming out soon.,
Hey! 50% down, 50% to go!,
All amidst record Fortune 500 earnings and the greatest bull market in history ladies & gentlemen,

You just need to consider who is doing the buying or selling of each of these two types of assets (oil vs oil companies).  

The buyers and sellers of oil companies are people looking to either get rid of an underperforming asset, or buy an asset they think is undervalued. They can have timelines as varied as the night is long. Each possible investor might have different calculations, indicators, timeframes, rationales, etc etc etc.  In short, the market isn't really unified. 

The sellers of oil, the commodity, tend to be extremely savvy traders employed by the oil companies or sovereign nations that are pumping the oil. The buyers of oil tend to be people who NEED oil to accomplish a core part of their business (gas stations, power companies, plastics manufacturers, etc).   And of course, traders exist on both sides. 

 These two classes are very very different from each other. Buyers and sellers of oil tend to be extremely supply-and-demand driven.   If you buy more stock shares than you need, you don't need to pay to store it anywhere. But if you buy more oil contracts than you need, you better close them out (ideally at a profit) before settlement, because if you don't, you're going to pay storage fees out the ass. 

The sellers of oil know that they need to dump their excess supply ASAP. There are other nations and producers out there trying to sell as fast as humanly possible to the buyers, so if you slow down even a bit, someone else will hit that bid and by the end of the day, you'll have sold less of your excess supply than the other seller, who got rid of more of it at a higher price. By selling faster than you, they stole your customer, and you're left with lower valued product on your hands that you need to liquidate. And this game isn't a joke. Your competitor can use those excess profits to expand, become more efficient, or start stealing your longer term customers. It is deathly serious, for companies and for nations. They do not fuck around. If the bottom is going to fall out, then it's going to fall out. You're better off getting rid of all your shit before it does, or at least get the best price possible as it's falling out.,
Oil is centered on what is happening in the next month or 2 and stock prices are centered on what is happening 6-12 months from now.

New lockdowns will reduce oil consumption in the short term but over the coming year oil is likely to go up and the oil producers will profit from it.,
US exporting more oil but not increasing domestic supply won't drop profits here noticably.,
My 3x leverage oil stocks moved!,
So this strain could still be covered by current immunity, governments could refuse to lock down for political reasons, we have a new tech platform for vaccines that can basically be edited like a word document, and in the background inflation is already roaring.  Oil is going up in 12mo and I am buying the dip,
Load up before Dec 2nd when OPEC says they aren’t increasing supply,
$MUR dropped 12%! Bought as much dip as possible.,
New Covid strain = less traveling, if we keep our current production then companies will pay to store oil which will cost $…. So the logical thing which is what the market is predicting is oil production and usage get cut which will drive down the price. 

Market is forward thinking,
As someone who has invested in energy for decades, if you can't take the volatility, get out. Because that won't change.,
Same reason lockdown stocks from last year had a decent day.,
These are diversified businesses.  Not just oil, but natural gas, refining and other chemicals businesses besides.,
The stocks underlying value is so disconnected from crude prices it doesn’t affect it as much as if it were over valued or fairly valued.,
The logic behind the drop in oil is the fear of another shutdown would stop the demand for oil . Seems overreacting to me. I’m long in several energy stocks and expect a rebound. For information and market news about oil check out oil price.com for a no BS analysis for all energy plays.,
Because the oil stocks know todays drop was retarded and it’s gonna bounce right back. Put 20K on UCO end of the day,
People just freaking out because of the new COVID strain.,
Biden considering releasing oil from the strategic reserve. It’s short lived move.,
Also have to look at which oil companies are hedged and how far out they are hedged.,
They don't live or die by one day of spot price action.  Their previous price hedges should absorb this and the market knows it.  They can also bring any halted production back online and simply pump more to make up the difference.  There's all kinds of things the big boys can do to average out the swings in the spot price (not to mention they're also diversified in a strong natural gas market), so the prices basically followed the herd today.,
Ken Griffin,
the smaller mid stream guys all got hammered.  I know.  I own a bunch of them.  Yeah, my CVX wasn't down much but damn near everything else was.,
The big question is why the fuck do you own xom?,
Many of the oil ETF’s don’t really track that closely with oil futures.  The futures themselves are probably the better play where that is concerned…,
I bought -16% CDEV dip. Probably catched falling knife,
Futures,
Oil is for losers. Shit is going bankrupt soon,
[deleted],
Because our markets aren't a reflection of reality, they are a casino run by criminals masquerading as federal regulators in the employ of bankers. 
They decide what has worth and what must fall to prop them up.,

Hot damn Spy took a massive nose dive,
what strikes were these puts?,
What's the expiry date on these, TODAY?

Hot damn that's a lucky play. Congrats.,
> 78 contracts 

lmao

just buy 8 SPX contracts next time, your tax return will thank you,
Does robinhood literally not tell you the strike put or call?,
You better buy $20k of $SPY/$SPX calls Monday. Going double down on SPY puts back to back and Jpow is gonna fuck you personally.,
Why is the time stamp in the corner the same?,
keep doing this and we'll be seeing you behind the wendy's dumpster by years end,
[deleted],
Congrats. I had a feeling spy was gunna nose, timed it wrong 24th instead of 26th could of closed in on a nice 50x profit. Got fucked and lost it all. Better luck next time for me. But I’m pumped someone else got some gains off this well anticipated dip.,

IV decay gonna stretch your ass,
You FOMO'd yourself into a hell of a coin flip. You have about 3 weeks for Moderna to explode again, much luck!,
If one were a true retard, one would buy options dated for next Friday,
9/10 on timing, just a touch off of the top,
wow you lucky it came through.. small lost!,
I feel this pain I bought some MRNA shares at $380 thinking it would hit $500. Then Merck announced the Covid pill. Sold for a 10% loss. Wish I would have jumped back in on that $250ish bottom.,
U won,

I have 6 that shot up today but I didn’t check until the market closed.  Thinking I missed the bus who knows what it will be Monday.,
Fliiped a dec 3 300 myself. Closed it out for 1200% gain. Congrats brother. Hope they keep ripping.,

How did you find MRK trade ?,
Hope you sold that mRNA position,
Kinky,
Get out of Merck,
You sold the 320 calls but kept the 400s? I think you got that backwards. Further out of the money calls are much more risky,

This strategy is commonly employed with VIX calls 

This is the first time I've seen someone ~~dumb~~ creative enough to do it with SPY puts,
u and your smart talk i just want money,
Unfortunately, this post is too good for what this sub has become,
What? Put it in terms my smooth brain can understand.,
I was doing this with calls on VIX for awhile, but it’s gotten harder to build a decent position for a net credit. 

Only advice is to open these further out (90-120DTE) and close them no matter what at 45DTE so you reduce exposure to theta and the valley of death. Ideally if you can afford 3-4 of them at a time you could cycle them so you constantly have some exposure.,
lost me at free,
Did you just discover Vega or something?,
This is wsb, who da fuk buys insurance, wtf is an insurance anyway,
So buy fear, sell greed.


Next.,
No one asked for this fuck off.,

This wasn’t the dip, Monday will be the dip. If previous patterns hold the remainder should be green but with omicron fears who knows?,
The only thing worth buying this morning was SVXY. Market still need a better correction,
I like this move,

I bought a used car last week and I didn't have a mechanic look at it because the dealership does a 150 pt inspection and offer a 3 month 3k mile warranty. I drove it about 100 miles and the tailpipe came right off the muffler. If this isn't a metaphor for my portfolio then I don't know what is,

Good thing we still have JPow's printers.,
Calls on me catching falling knives today.,
Stimmy talks going well,
I’m off today and I feel like I’m working,
Imagine going Black Friday shopping with your wife all morning then you open your investing app and see that you are down 5% pre market,

if this variant kills me, i die. if it doesn’t, i sure as hell won’t be the one who didn’t buy the dip. good luck, everyone.,
Weakest sell off ive ever seen,

It turns out that the guy who wanted to short the whole country of South Africa was onto something.,
I imagine like 90% of the people here don't know today's close time,
The weird day where your stock is red but not as red as everything else so your calls are green,
It's kinda hilarious that SPY could drill 10% and it would still be one of the greatest years in history for the index,
WSB may be the world's first unorganized religion,
Just lost 10k upon waking up

Wish I could buy puts on my intelligence because I'm retarded,
BUYING CALLS ON SPY ASAP,
final reminder for you dumb fucks this is over in 37 mins,
I swear to fucking god if I sold the bottom I am literally going to quit,
How does the EU already have travel restrictions in place for the new variant and J&J already have testing for a new variant vaccine in place?  This is like the 5th or 6th variant that made news and somehow it was decided that an urgent universal reaction is need.  

America goes on vacation for one day and everyone loses their minds.   Sorry guys I'm still not answering my emails to Monday now matter how many times you capitalize URGENT,

Reading this thread you’d think we were down $1 or something in pre.

Not $8 dollars lmao.,

I think everyone will be happy for market to close early 🤔,
Good thing I’m only in roblox,
damn i already used my dip buying money and can’t open a second mortgage in time,
So are we to expect annual COVID FUD crashes instead of every 8-10 years now? They better find an immortality spell for that cause not a single soul would be able to retire,

First time I’ve ever been Margin called. Fuck me,
“It can’t get any worst”

WSB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Latest covid variant just an excuse to sell off. Market needs the correction though.,
this shit makes no fucking sense

MRNA has said they can reconfigure the vax for variants very quickly if needed

only reason they didnt do it for delta is because they didnt need to, it was already effective

there's gotta be other reasons for this dump. but all I can think of is frontrunning eoy tax sales or tapering 

its possible we've just been in a bear market all along and this was the actual rug pull,
10k worth of MRNA calls would’ve made you a millionaire today,
If SPY closes down 2%, media will go nuts this weekend.  Real money will be made on Monday.,
They turning Black Friday into *BLACK FRIDAY*.,
Bro these variants will never stop,
Good thing the market closing early...will not lose money all day.,
My brokerage app just deleted itself.,
This bitch margin calling again! Pick up or delete app?,
CLOSE THE MARKETS,
remember when everyone thought stocks were a bubble at 320 pre-covid and it has rocketed up to 460 since then?,
Seriously this month every stock I touched crashed even though the setup was solid. Luck is very important.,
Went to cash on Wednesday and only lost $35 today. Life is good on this side.,
Fuck the market all my homies trade on dark pools,
Just woke up on the west coast.  Unbelievable.,
Tech about to surge boys,

I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that some dude on here literally bought weekly UVXY calls right at market close on a friday after a 30% spike. 

Is that the dumbest trading position possible? I can not think of anything dumber. He was so confident about it too. Like are you okay sir?,
Everyone talks about the massive thanksgiving meal, but no one talks about the massive thanksgiving dump the next day.,
There have been over a dozen variants of concern / interest / monitoring so far.

It’s probably a >50% chance this turns out to be a nothingburger for the US economy.

After 1.5 years of shrugging off every covid-related headline, the market suddenly cares about this?! More likely it’s market making algorithms capitalizing on low volume to generate volatility for their benefit.,
Tesla says they have a vaccine in production.,
You know that shit already here in the US!!,
Bankruptcy, we meet again 😟,
Breaking News: No one gives a fuck,
Time to talk to the kids about Trade Schools.,

Little tip:

If you go inside the Wendy's they have a red wig and an outfit you can wear while you work out back. My average payout per day increased by 2x. They just ask that you get it dry cleaned before you return it.,
$shop because people are gonna dunk all their holiday money even earlier from rising prices and out of stock trauma. 

Etsy because asian factory workers doesn’t impact American hippies making necklaces at home

Rblx because when shit inevitably goes out of stock that kid is getting a gift card,
WE WILL OWN EVERYTHING AND WE WILL BE HAPPY,
A lot of the time it's just luck; I liquidated a lot of my long-term option positions the past 2 weeks because of the divergences in the market (heavy selling on small cap/high growth stocks while the mega caps held up strongly).

Still going to take some losses on open positions, but the difference between 80% cash and 20% cash is huge.,
Is that a reversal I smell,
Cathie must have a massive smile on her face right now.,
We all know this will be completely shrugged of by next week. This is the time to profit from anxiety und myopic trading. 🤑,

Good enough to screenshot. Good enough to sell. 

Take the win bro.,
OP when you cashing out?   Waiting for the run the next couple of weeks?,
great choice. every time the vaccine stocks fall, I feel “the virus is fizzling out… those stocks are over.” all that happened was the price was low, time to buy in. brave of you to take the risk. like a money making machine! enjoy the pay off!,
Wish I had gotten on this train.,
How the hell did you see it coming? How did you move on it so quickly?,

My DEC 12 465P up 141%,
My 465 printed beautifully,
Damn that shit was well timed!  Who said you can’t time the market,
I hope you close out today. This dip is transitory.,
Life is so great. The bloodbath should have been ignited by taper and rate hikes and we have a new variant with rate and oil price drop ! So fun.,
Congrats retard.  My 1/22 458's are still a few bucks away from being green.  Granted I'm coming from -90%, but still....,
r/antstreetbets,
Damm I got calls 😂 12/31 $493,
Will you close out today? I have SPY and QQQ puts and wondering if I should take the profit or wait for Monday,
Kicking myself for closing at open. I’ve been hurt too often.,
Great, you get to make 4 grand and totally piss everybody off about it.  sweet.,

So… stonks go up? Please?,
Which dip? This one or the one that's after the dipping dip?,
You know it's 2% dip when you start seeing Warren Buffet quotes in r/stocks,
This is called “The Print”,
Look at that divergence confirmation! Rip, bulls,
Insert Warren Buffett quote! BTDF!,
Buy the Dip’s dip’s dip. Don’t buy here because this isn’t TA,
Nothing to see here on the MACD... Keep buying calls, SPY only goes up after red days 🙄😏,
Kind of a low angle for the moon,

What's the saying of this sub? If it's good enough to screenshot & post, it's good enough to sell.,
Think with covid news could see more but hard to not take a profit. Sell one and let the other go,
100% is a good return. I would suggest to sell,
If you made double what you invested cut and walk away. I'm sure you experienced the drop off of losing all the gains and then some.,
Never regret making a profit.  There is always opportunity. You live to fight another day.,
Sell before you regret it,
Sell immediately. This IS financial advice,
Sell the 50 calls and keep the 60 ones,
Sell,
You're smart enough to charge your phone, but are you smart enough to cash out a gain?,
Sell.

If the news comes out that the vaccine isn't working against the new variant it'll drop. If the news comes out that the new variant isn't that bad it'll drop. If COVID disappears it'll drop. If people have bad reactions to boosters it'll drop.

My point is that many things could make it drop. You got great profit there. Take it and be merry.,
If it’s worth posting, it’s worth selling!!!!!!!!,
Sell,
Always take profits,
Sell,
I have $55 calls and am up about 140%, plan to sell next week.,
80% rule, let the rest ride.,
Wait 2 more weeks until they come out new variant result.,
You should hold until it hits zero and make a post complaining about it,
depends. are you reGarded, or not reGarded?,
you would become a pathetic paper handed pussy,
*Doubles their money* "hm is this good enough?",
Could sell half since you’re up 100%,
Always take profits. Ask me how I know. (There will always be more money, can’t lose it if you’ve sold it already),
You should hold.  It’ll only gain in value.,
Absolutely, you are almost guaranteed to lose to IV crush alone,
Take the profit, IMHO.

One new variant and PUFF. Zero. 

Or maybe they pull off again one of their insanely awesome PR stunts. In that case....KACHING.,
Buffett would sell,
I'd sell 50% and use the remaining as a pure and simple gamble that another kneejerk reaction is gonna happen,
🎶Should i stay or should i go ! 🎶,
GTFO

TIL it's possible to make a profit buying PFE options.,
Sell at least half.,
I always sell when I screenshot. Then just put all that money in the bank and refuse to touch it because the market has a way of getting that money back if you keep it in your account too long.,
New rule, +%100, sell.,
Take that profit,
Honestly I've been burned being greedy like this. When I wake up and see my options ever above 80% gain I sell. Fuck those  BABA puts I had. Grr,
What’s the saying? If it’s good enough for a picture hold everything until it’s worthless.

I think that’s how it goes?,
Fuck you n FUCK PFIZER.,
PFE has a gap to fill and I am hoping it happens before next year. In all of it's years; it's NEVER been this high. Honestly, I am surprised that it is holding so well. Yet, I have been burned many times before with this stock; so take some while you can.,
Hold till 0,

A rare picture of Zuck before his monthly skin shedding remarkable,

Every selection is perfect, don't change a thing.,
Elizabeth's picture, lol,
How is WSB not chaotic neutral? This place is literally dedicated to making (extreme) bets on wallstreet.,
If you think WSB is anything but Chaotic alignment you haven't been paying attention,
Shrekli is missing. He's should be in the middle.,
Where is Xi the Pooh?,
Chaotic Evil 😂😂😂,
Elon didn't inhale,
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out),
Should i yolo spy puts, *rolls for intiative*,
What is the WSB consensus group think on Elizabeth Holmes? Is she welcomed as a hero here or villain?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This is as beautiful as am retard,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Who is the woman,
Don't be fooled, those mfers on the last row are all chaotic evil.,
JPOW is lawful neutral? Say what? He made more money than any other fed chair in history. Shady corrupt piece of shit,
Where tf is shkreli!?,
This is just.. so good. Glad my phone randomly recommended it.,
Chelsea Clinton looking good,
Did DFV ever sell?,
Do this but with people who are actually on wall st.,
Where is my chaotic retarded square?,
But many shady people uses WSB to pump'n'dump meme stocks tho! Like #WISH,
It's rare to see the crazy eyes BEFORE dating the girl. If only it was always that obvious,
Such good picture choices too. Bravo! 👏,
Bears are Neutral Evil tbh because they want everything to crash and burn.,
Elizabeth Holmes' alignment is chaotic sexy.,
Ken Griffin:Evil Evil,
Who’s top left?,
Who is top right?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
so in a year , Elon falls from Chaotic good to Chaotic neutral... can't wait for next year,
Why everyone is hating Dr Manhattan?,
i'm not a cat! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Probably Peter Schiff needs to be at center of 3 axis - Lawful Neutral Good.,
We need to get Papa Silverback in here too,
WSB is chaotic neutral.,
You could remove all knowledge of Mark Z from humanity and that pic would still be perfectly titled.,
This is so spot on.,
SEARCH MINERALS,
Is that Chelsea Clinton?!!,
Idk who the girl is,
The bang and bounce.,
I have never known uber rich CEOs before attending this sub.

AMD 200 EOY AND I WILL MOTORBOAT sue ba's MICRO TITTIES,

I'm all aboard, sorry Jay.,
Sorry for dumb question, who's in Lawful Good & Neutral Good photos?,
Who's neutral good again, Mugatu?,

My god, who formatted this!?,
I wonder where Shkreli would fall.,
Disagree with some,
Where's Bogdanoffs and Sminem?,
[removed],
I refuse to believe that Jep Bombos is lawful evil. pretty sure he sees only three types of peoples: customers, employs and thieves (his ex-wife).,
Where my boy Vlad?,
Who's the man that is lawful good and neutral good?,
I've actually been working on a 5x5 alignment chart and it's fairly similar, although I put DFV more on the lawful side.,
Pretty sure we’re chaotic something,
wait who's neutral good,
Musk neutral?

Nah, clearly evil, but the chaotic is spot on.,
powell isn't lawful neutral. his mandate is to keep markets going up. theta gang is lawful neutral.,
Where’s Martin shkreli?,
Who is bottom right,
He is neutral good, but his hair is chaotic evil.,
Elizabeth Holmes looks like someone just grabbed her magic ring.,
Musk is chaotic neutral while zuck is neutral evil?  Zuck himself believes in free healthcare and free education.  He also treats his workers VERY well while musk abuse the shit out of him.  Stupid meme,
Musk is good though.,
Chaotic evil, is that's the Clinton'S daughter, Chelsea or something like that,
Have we already forgotten about our saviour Martin Shkreli?,
went to court for making millis,
this is our bible,
J pow is evil,
Missing Archegos Hwang as chaotic good,
Elon is definitely more evil than neutral,
Putting Elon at neutral shows how brainwashed people are,
[removed],
You forgot the part where it’s in a ROTH thus 100% tax free gains… THATS the “get better” part. 

Congrats and fuck you.,
Wait you can loan out your shares in any brokerage ??,
Which app is this where you can loan them out,
Yeah never seen this before. And who would pay that high interest rate?,
Go to Arqits home page and play their video. 
It's something straight out of Silicon Valley,
Are you loaning out shares on Merrill? How do I opt-in to this?,
If you loan your shares out can you sell covered calls?,
The Guy on the other side of the trade having a rough day lol,

Why market freaking out? Don’t they know JPow can cure rona with printer? 🤦‍♂️,
Just buy the dip. This is a buying opportunity,
Lmao the market is a scam,
Robinhood's having a blackfriday sale on big oil and crusieliners!  

Use codes "BP" and "CCL" to reveal your special offer!,
So this is the only good news Today![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
It’ll come back, oil always comes back,
Watching some March USO 44Cs that just got absolutely slaughtered. Black Friday sale for some buyers today for sure. I mean the broad market just got hefty haircut on a lot of assumption. Something fishy here isn't adding up and someone is definitely taking advantage of this seemingly spontaneous sell off. I only know that someone is not me. Oof.,
Good, should be easier to fill my tank soon,
Every time I want to exit my oil positions, they kick me in the Jimmy..’fuckers,
Just as my portfolio was almost out of the red. Bye bye 2 months of gains!,
OPEC should cut supply every time a new variant comes out. That should be good enough to stop all this variant fear mongering from governments.,
Whoopity do Another made up bs “variant” market already doesn’t care about it just like that supposed “delta” variant. Tesla didn’t even go to a lower low on the weekly with that news on top of all of the selling. Tesla ripping next week,
So about those reserves we were going to release...,
Go back to 0 so I can load up.,
So weird how oil rallied hard over the last year but oil stocks barely went up more than 10% in the same time period.,
That’s not a crash. That’s just a double Friday.  Monday will be up 15%,
Dont panic whales are collecting your money :) there have been dozens of variants,why that one matters so much? because it is all about manupilation.if you keep your positios on then add some short orders to balance your risk these days.,
Laughing like shit about all the “buy the oil dip” dipshits posting here just two days ago. Dumbasses.,
In india oil prices will still rise,

You missed a much more important bearish point, which is last year the big platforms like Google, Microsoft are not well adopted for video conferencing. Over the year they developed their platform and is now on par or way better than Zoom while Zoom stagnant and cashed in on the pandemic hype. e.g. Teams offer cheaper subscription than Zoom and offer a whole lot of other tools as a suite.

Position: Sold calls ZM 230 7DTE,
> You can argue Teams is better

That's where you lost me,
lol I guarantee almost every poster in here has puts. ZM will most likely trend up if the news decides to fear monger this variant for a couple weeks,
I think people are too quick to write off Zoom.  Though there are competitors, they all have problems relative to Zoom which has kept a simple easy to use interface and has focused on video quality (low latency).

My personal observations on competitors:
* Teams: still clunky interface and non-intuitive for ordinary users. 
* WebEx: terrible performance, resource hog
* Google Chat:  almost no one uses this.  Seems to lack features.

I don't think the potential lockdowns from the Omicron variant will make that much of a difference.  Most companies with white collar professionals will still do hybrid workplace, so the vertical growth is not there like in 2020.

But I think people underestimate how important it is for small businesses, schools, local government that don't have a big fancy IT department to be able to use a simple standalone video conferencing app that works well on desktop, ipad, and phone.

I think $400 by February is a stretch, but $250 by year end?  Sure, why not.

This is not a value stock (trailing PE of 58), but by today's growth stock valuations, it's got upside from the recent post earnings range of $195-$225.,
ZM doesn't have anything that is special. This space is commoditized. ZM is a bi product of the original Webex. They just happen to be this high due to the pandemic and is finally adjusting downwards from its highs.,
If the variant is bad then zoom will go up if it’s not then it will go down simple….I think the better play is moderna,
Teams,
It won’t go back up to ATH again. Companies are  requiring Its employees to get vaccinated and be in the office.,
Zoom is an inferior product, it was just convenient when the pandemic started. Now that businesses have had time to move to Teams or whatever else, Zoom is going to leak customers until they hit $10/share.,
what you are missing is the society's will to stay at home again.  

also, zoom has been here for years, they have gotten alot of customers already.  
im not sure a 3rd pandemic would suddenly be able to net them more growth.  

the reason the stock is down its because the p/e ratio is ridiculous while growth is slowing.,
Why is this power point presentation here?,
Give it a couple more days. Latency of covid is just enough to make people complacent about omicron. Then the cases will rise 5-14 days after thanksgiving. Zoom will trend up and always has the ability to gap up quick.,
As the delta disappeared without changing anything. So will this one.   Only real issue I see with this one is the fact they're pushing more to vaccine young children.,
It’s very simple. Zoom has no moat and is inferior on an enterprise basis from a security and VOIP perspective to both MSFT and RNG (among others), not to mention its concerns regarding relations to China and rejection of its bid for FiveNine (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/09/30/zoom-and-five9-agree-to-terminate-acquisition-plan.html).,

Thank the lord I sold my baba calls right before close on Wednesday for a small profit.,
THREE TOURS OF FALLUJAH AINT SHIT WHEN I THINK OF ALL THE RED ON MY CHINA POSITIONS,
Fuck...I have a sizeable holding in Nio...what fresh hell is this,
Stay away from Chinese stock but this is good news for any current holders based on the article, they plan to offer the ipo price of 14.,
What about NIO, XPEV and LI?,
Why should these companies be affected by DIDI delisting?,
Good 👍 As long as the CCP is there they'll pull this with other companies and Fck US investors without lube
. If you invested in Chinese companies knowing, then you must liking getting rammed. 😆,
I'm not currently in any ChinaStocks, but this may give a great opportunity to buy in to one of these companies. We know China never wanted Didi to IPO, so this is almost nothing new. Dips in some quality companies could be juicy buying opps.,
Add FUTU to the mix!,
Lulz

They were warned,
Wait im not sure i understand what is happening. I have some money in nio. What should i do with it?,
Wdym bro, XPeng ripping higher,
Jesus these BABA puts just KEEP. FUCKING. PRINTING.,
When did wallstreetbets turn to an anti-China FUD page? Is this page officially run by Hedgefunds?,
Where’s that guy with the $3 nio calls 800k in profit but was determined to hold another year a few days ago? 🤡…if it’s good enough to screenshot,
My god.. look at DIDI on the daily chart, it's textbook DCB,
F,
F,
F,
F,
Delisting means more $$ going unto US stocks.,
Nio will be okay right? RIGHT?,
S&P is down more than NIO so I guess China is the safe haven.,
Chynaa !,
Investing in China is treason, press S to spit,
RIP. 😂 This is literally my profolio.,
idk, I might buy some xpeng,
Yep. Not buying any NIO now. Fuck that.,
That’s what you get for investing in gyna. Zero promise of equity, zero chance of uncooked books, and zero chance of genuine growth with Winnie the Pooh at the helm.,
as of today i'm 50% down on PDD,
Time to buy tbh,
I can't help but chuckle that anyone ever thought that the communist could be trusted.,
Don't invest in communism.,
China is a fools gold economy.

That's all there is to it. Fake fugazzi zieeziipzoop nothing there- all made up and manipulated .

Plenty of stocks to buy in the free world markets not sure why you'd throw money at the commies.  So they can turn around and fk you.,
Lots of comments about don’t trust CCP, don’t invest in China’s markets, China is fools gold, etc. 
If people really believed that, why continue to support companies who moved their manufacturing there?  Don’t you think having buildings and manufacturing there puts more dependence on them than investing in their stocks??,
5 day old account FUD, piss off,
Doesn't that mean if you hold shares you just continue to hold it excpet tradeable on another exchange,
(my portfolio) burn baby burn. I have bought BABA at the begining of the week. Fuck you China.,
You all deserve it for investing in a country who can arbitrarily jerk around publicly traded companies lmao,
What is twitch chat now?,
🆘 guh,
F,
Wait, let’s talk about a play here; the stick is currently at 8.11 and the CCP has noted for the company to pay 14. Why is this not a buy for the proceeds? What is my small brain missing,
F,
Has everyone seen the futures market??  Think we are all screwed today on this one,
How does this affect UBER?,
I love the meme but missed the news. Who wants to explain what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow?,
where's the guy who has a million in baba calls?,
Puts on the less famous ones so no IV crush,
Might as well throw $F in there too while we’re F’in the chat,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
NIO is fine.   I bet it doubles in the next year.   China bailed out the company and owns a fair amount of it.   since data goes from cars to satellites to china internal network, they won't have a problem.,
F,
Still keeping NIO… it’s been a difficult ride the past 10 months, but through the fud and anti China their results and expansion are superb,
Fuck me is there a list of stocks or literally all Chinese companies are leaving?,
Chinese Stocks are cash grabs. There’s a case for the EV stocks but who knows if they’ve been inflating their numbers/progress.,
If you bought Chinese stocks your an idiot sorry bro,
what do you think is going to happen to [JD.com](https://JD.com)? It's chinese, but has been doing well - will it go down eventually?,
F,
Every Chinese stocks lmao,
Sold my DIDI crap this morning with 60% loss as soon as I saw that news on my SSE account.  I was a bag holder for few months. Screw Chinese shits. Never trust them.,

As far as I understand it looks like omicron is easier to detect than delta so it seems like short term we should see many cases reported around the world which could lead to even greater panic.,
Hey OP, 
I think a quite important detail is the vaccination rate in the country.
SA is around 20% from what I found in a quick google search.,
My NVAX seems to enjoy this news.,
Bro the delta variant may leave you with erectile dysfunction and most dummies still don’t care about it. Bottom line: people will continue spending, debt will grow and the money printer hasn’t been turned off yet, yet….,
More Covid = more printer. Bullish,
Printer vs. Variant.,
There's been like 10 variations already and they'll be 10+ more.  I'm buying any dips,
I will YING and you YANG,
Why did they decide to name it omicron? It just sounds nasty and deadly,
my EXPE calls are FUCKED lol,
JPOW is speaking monday at 3 and tuesday at 10. Gonna buy calls after the dip monday morning. 

EZ $$,
Covid 19 the 2022 election variant…,
CHILL…THIS ISN’T END TIMES
==================================

We’ve seen this movie before.

Some stonks are gonna get crushed…for a good reason…Travel, Hospitality, etc…

Other stonks may dip…but, shouldn’t be dipping at all…Solid US Tech companies.

This new variant may keep JPOW printing…delay taper…delay rate hikes.

THINK BEFORE YOU HIT THE SELL BUTTON
==================================,
I buy calls.

I believe! :)

ANd seriously, I think such a sharp dive will result in a correction. People overreacted....cannot believe that the entire S&P500 is so dependant on it, not with a fataility rate around 0,02 percent. What they are gonna do if all their customers over 83 years old fall down dead? 

Not much money in it anyway. Just for giggles :),
Tech will outperform value and financials/reopening will be in deep shit again 
Tech and memes 🚀🚀🚀🚀,
I’m not reading this.

Spy calls help the brrrr,
Reminds me of the posts in late March 2020 that convinced me that buying $DIS 80 puts would print because “wHo’s gOiNg tO dIsneYwoRld now?”,
Anybody else bothered by the fact they called it the "Nu" variant? We've got plenty of greek letters to pick from and they pick the one that makes people say new "Nu" on tv and it sounds stupid.,
LoL just another bs variant that’ll hang around in the news a few days so pharma can get more government money. They’ll keep Covid around as long as possible so long as it keeps making money. Probably the best market manipulator ever designed! I wonder what variant they’ll have lined up for December for us?,
Praying for my spy calls.,
Looks like it was labeled variant of concern might be another covid bear market,
Good news for Palantir Bagholders,

As a bagholder, I approve of this message 👌,
my bag at $35 is getting heavy,
Bag holding at 30. It’s a healthy expanding company in a forever growing industry and I can comfortably hold the shares for five more years. Having said that I wouldn’t really recommend buying calls other than leaps,
Im bagholding crsr, wouldnt recommend buying in till its found a good bottom though,
I just bought some a minute ago. I’m at 25% CRSR and still buying. Not selling anything until $42-45. 🚀,
Lost my first couple thousand on CRSR. No thanks,
No stress. Watched this one since IPO and only just got in over august at around $27. Averaged down slightly since then and will continue to do so. This should be a fairly solid long term growth stonk.,
Ah the daily CRSR bagholder’s copium thread. It’s like clockwork,
I Keep on buying the dips, this one is pretty juicy,
According to this subreddit CRSR has been an opportunity plenty of times this year! An opportunity to lose money,
♿️,
Dear god, shut the fuck up. Every time someone shills CRSR on this ape infested sub it drops another 5%,
Corsair at its current price is such a value play, waiting for it to blow!,
Soooo, buy Tesla? Okay,
Oh oh oh, I know what you mean about high short interest. For those who didn't get his reference, high short interest means lots of people smarter than us think the stock will go down.,
This could work. I bought $EA as well Wednesday and it held up during yesterday's blood orgy.,
I should've bought puts.,
you literally ignored (or are ignorant to) the biggest factor: eagle tree,
Increase your wacc until the value equals 70% of current price. Now your DCF is correct.,
Give me a killer options yolo,

Hahahahahahahaha bro. For anyone who doesn't know, this works the same way every year. Wednesday and Friday are half days the week of thanksgiving,
gotcha op,
…unless the world goes south during the weekend and it opens itm,
Welp I guess that means ATH mon at the open?,
I lost 35$ once. It’s tough. Hang in there,
Fuck thats rough,
Made $30K beaver dollars (25k USD) on ZM YOLO, bought 20 x 215C exp Nov 26 for $1.65, went down to 0.43 and said fuck it lets ride this to the ground!
  
Turns out my wonka chocolate had the golden ticket, and ZM blasted off to the moon leaving the rest of the market in a sea of piss.

Yolo dreams do come true!,
You gotta thank the new Covid variant…
Damn I also bought the 215 C at the fake out on Wed. Thank goodness I decided to hold on. 
Wanted to see where the market will take it after market open, but it seemed that there was strong rejection so I sold it for a 600% gain

But it seems like my profits went into overpriced calls for MRNA next week.( Bought one 400c at the HOD) 😭,
What’s the flair? I’m tryna look at its charts,
This motheefucker holding 13k shares of Sears,
Have a steak tonight,
What platform is this? I'm really trying get into more, also the reoccurring one i see often here too,

Im in with jan 21 $400 call, bought at 2.30 30 ATM i hold, BNTX is actualy discount, and with the recent new thats just the beg,
good instincts!,

Get out of the US stocks. They're overblown at the moment.  Take a look at the UK ftse.. it's actually lower than a few years ago, but contains so many great stocks, also the UK gvt have been printing money like it's going out of fashion.  Everywhere is saying invest in UK stocks right now.

The UK stock market is literally having a black Friday sale.  Everything is poised to go parabolic.  Just whack a pile into any ftse 100 tracker and come back in three years and see the gainz....,
YTD up 55%. Fuck you.,

90% of everything I own is over leveraged and 12%+ short interest. I have so few fundamental plays right now, and the ones that are fundamental still have untold amount of synthetics in circulation.,
Supposed to be good for your eyes if you stare at it in the morning,
Red is the sexiest color,
Yup mines just tanked this week really bad.  $eyes stock is killing me. Just wanted to get back to what I put in like everyone else and then get out.  But don’t think this stock will ever go up again pass 3.10🙁,

That's surprising. Really didn't expect 5% of products to comply with our law. Somehow expected everything to be non compliant. All Wish products can basically be sorted in two categories: (1) Dangerous or (2) Fake.,
That feeling when your eating your last pack of ramen noodles on Thanksgiving and you hear rent a center knocking on your door.,
[deleted],
All you goons that YOLO'd this shit better not skimp on that loss porn. I'm looking forward to beating my dick like it owes me money.,
What do you mean..? that my crossbow that shoots toothpicks  I ordered from WISH  is dangerous??,
Is this a buy signal?

No to be honest  this could  mean  $WISH is super fucked. 

Based on Q4 results Europe  is 46% of their revenue and EU(while this would not apply whole Europe it would cover 80% of consumers in Europe) could easily require them to pull their non compliant products from marketplace which  sounds like most of them.,
Fucking LOL. KeeP averAgInG dOWn!,
I know there’s some bag holders here that keep pumping, but it’s an absolute dumpster fire of a company and no one should touch it,
"Dont worry guys the moon is within our sights now",
So calls then??,
[deleted],
Still can't figure out why wishtards invested in a company spending shipping fees to deliver the equivalent of dog shit.

I know some stocks can go up on shitty businesses but damn wish is awful,
Edit: The article is in italian,
Googling how to buy put options right now.,
More $WISH bagholding loss posts next week,
With the kind of garbage they sel I am surprised they are a company listed on the stock market.,
Wish to the moon!!!! I have a feeling.,
Just when you thought this company couldn't f*ck up any more.......,
Thing is, this is nothing new in terms of the uphill fight Wish has.

They know they need to sort their fucking shit out or they're fucked.

I can see the bearish view here, but actually, if you're bullish, this is good. It just means they'll ultimately have to expedite their shit sorting or goodbye Europe, and goodbye Wish.

This is the only way Wish will change. Threats and real consequences.,
Pooooots!,
What’s the % for Amazon and eBay?,
Perfect. Useless trash website with trash products haha: only exist for YouTube funny videos,
Next on the list: BABA,
What’s France?,
WISH TARGETS $20
WE SAVE WISH and BABA,
Penny stock soon?,
I $wish this stock would go to zero.,
Lol look on bright side tax writeoff for the year 🥲🤘,
Lmao clearly this is black market China garbage lmao how do people not see this,
It's another ladder attack from the shorts!,
So the short interest is about %600, looks like WSB needs to get into it.,
Cooked goose.,
Why is literally anyone surprised,
“Dump it” Bog 1 & Bog 2,
Wow for once when I say I can’t read the article it isn’t a joke,
I live in the US and wish had this ambiguous posting for what looked to be dead cats for sale. I’m pretty sure dead cats are 100% organic. However, I don’t think Amazon got as a big as it is by selling dead cats.,
Dam 5% of their products comply with their law I'm shocked it's that high,
Good. It's all fake, garbage, or fake garbage.,
Well, RIP, my $375.,
Very good news. Wish is only low-quality garbage products that in the end only pollute our environment.,
Ahahahahahaaa get fucked,
$WISH is like a spam website. Who would buy anything off that?,
Hahaha! The French has standard? 🥖,
[deleted],
How are Wish bag holders gonna spin this to imply Wish is still going to the moon?,
Fucking LOLLLLLL,
You have to be stupid to buy stock in this blatant Chinese scam site.,
Thank you for posting something that’s been reposted about 4 times already in the past 24 hours my bags appreciate it,
This mean moon? When?,
Chinese crap that are crappier than what you think you are getting.,
The part that bothers me is regulators asking a search engine to delete it from search results.,
“bUt tHeY hAvE zErO dEbT!!1!”,
Happy I sold everything (at loss),
Not that I am hoping anyone investing in wish does badly, but I'm glad the regulators are cracking down on a load of essentially illegal cheap crap coming into the continent,
Well $wish is trash though soooo,
What in the world is even making people hold this stock?,
Bullish, their products won't hurt people in another country.,
No worries I went to their reddit, the consensus is that WISH doesn't have any distributions centers compared to amazon therefore no costs associated with maintaining or investing in this expensive infrastructure. Better load up on those bags it's only matter of time before wish overtakes amazon as prime e-commerce giant.,
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA,
The thing is they are just "blocked" anyone that has the app already can still keep using it and ordering, anyone else can still easily find a way to download the .apk file or whatever the fuck you call app downloads. Not saying this is bullish or anything just making it clear for anyone who doesn't know.,
Fuck wish,
Good lol,
Rip to all investors,
I swear any idiot who invested in wish deserves it, any actually ordered their product? Cheap knock offs and even silicon stuff is way below the shit grade at a dollar tree. Your money would've burnt less if you invested in dollar general or dollar store than this Chinese stock. It's all leading up to this being like that fake coffee stock.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Calls on Monday after it settles down!,
Wish puts gonna go brrrrrrr once they announce bankruptcy 😅,
This is already being addressed with Wish Standards. Ima just 💎🙌,
RIP Wish bagholders,
RIP bag holders..,
:o,
DaFuk is that thumbnail,
I $WISH THIS WAS JUST A BAD DREAM,
What is wish?,
IM GLAD MY CHICKEN HELMET IS APPROVED BY THE EU,
Damn’ wish and direct smile bag holders seem to never catch a break. It will be a cold summer lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
Lol when it rains,
That’s great f some drop shipped Chinese shit,
Should be blocked in America. Straight trash,
[removed],
The big short,
okay sell it all,
Bruh it just gets better and better

By which I mean it gets worse and worse for Wish lmfao,
Glad I never invested jn that shit show,
so it going dip on friday?,
If we can’t read English what makes you think we can read Chinese,
I really WISH i would have kept my puts,
Oh shit, some WISHes are about to come true,
Omfg please do this everywhere,
My proudest achievement is making money on this trashcan of a company.,
I've seen bankrupt companies stock shoot through the roof -- so we're getting close to payday,
Now can we do that here?,
Hahaha… and many of these apes went full retarded with their calls on this POS,
SEARCH MINERALS,
In this market this could send the stock to Mars smh,
Lol anyone who actually bought this garb deserves this 100%,
My 4 call options aren’t going to be looking to hot after this.,
This company is legitimately a complete shit show.,
Why would anyone ever use Wish when there is AliExpress? The price and quality are much better..,
ok calls it is then,
Not safe? Now I gotta go buy something. I wonder if they sell Jarts?,
They were fun. I miss them.,
Terrible app!!! They scammed $80 from me and never gave them back, they're thieves!!,
*Sells naked calls to buy puts*,
They should just change their name to Shamazon.,
Going to 2$ boys, let’s go!!,
Fuck Wish... Dont care about the stock. Its just shit. Everything you buy is shit, its smell shit and taste like shit.,
So puts be printing?,
Go CLOV WSB lets support it’s like gme and AMC,
Why anyone would look at wish and think its a good investment boggles my mind.. Although I did invest in two shit Chinese companies so clearly I am a retard as well.,
Don't worry guys this is surely the bottom,
Call me frenchbread because I’m in pain.,
What if the CCP started the $WISH hype on WSB using bot accounts, then tanked the stock to oblivion to steal all the West’s tendies?,
It's alright, Look on the bright side, we can all buy some rope off Wish but it'll probably break before we even set up the noose,
It's almost like anyone who have actually used Wish knew that it wasn't a great stock to purchase.,
Wish is the ticker that perfectly sums up how retarded this community is.,
Everyone's so mad about wish. You can buy a ton of cheap things that are honestly the same quality, compared to the "original/real" product that has a premium price on it for whatever reason.,
Wish in one hand...,
To be fair has anyone ever bought something from wish and not expected to be ripped off and laugh about it though? Its kinda like the dudes that get off when someone kicks them in the balls. Kinda the point right? 😂,
Alright so call me crazy and I am but like what if all this bad news is a major buy signal and this stock couldn’t get beat down any further than it already has? Like it can’t go lower…can it??? Just imagine how cheap it is now and with all these bag holders holding in the 9-18 range you could scalp off some pumps with this stock now.

Who am I kidding that is crazy…unless…,
I'm buying more.,
Wasn't this stock going to $10,000 because we're all smooth brain apes whos wife's boyfriend couldn't interrupt our own circle jerk???,
Bag holders can contact me if you just need someone to talk to,
This is a company that should remained private damn greedy incompetent CFO/CEO are taking these companies private too soon before they have viable to profitability or even a business model. Just look at post CNBC SPAC index (I know wish isn’t a spac but you get the idea).,

Oh nooooo,
question, my dad uses hearing aids bought from wish last year, should we throw them out or? worried about his health,
Rip to the guy here who was all in and going down with the ship.,
And yet Eurotrash is going to come on here and tell me how terrible my country is

Eat shit Europe.,
The app that offered me free brass knuckles with my first order is full of dangerous goods?  Surprised Pikachu face.


For real, do amazon next.  Not a whole lot better,
So... time to YOLO into Wish on the dip?,
Naturally, I’m buying calls,

Your call rose 1400%, and you’re not selling in hopes it’ll continue to go up to 10000%? You sir are Forest Gump levels of retarded.,
Incoming reversal….,
Pls raise you stop loss….  Bu then again they might roll out a new booster to deal with the new variant,
Ahh fellow IBKR trader,

Lockdown round 2 you say? Time to invest in lotion and tissues.,
If you're in america, I wouldn't go worrying about a lockdown,
Doesn't matter, people use reddit for their porn now. Unless they pull some tumblr shit,
PLBY, extra bullish for a pandemic play 😅😎,
If there is a lockdown that will skyrocket. Why do you think all the toilet paper sold out during the first round.,

finally! a corona named after a gundam,
New strain is the catalyst we need. Spy 600 eoy?,
My Spy calls are fucd,
In related news, FT is clearly hiring WSB members because the fucking title of this BS is “News from Oct 25…”,
My PFE puts should be golden, they say it’s resistant strain. Could go either way. Fingers crossed,
My portfollio is full of COVID recovery gamble stocks like leisure and travel. Figured if COVID did ease I'd be in the money.

Today is not a good day.,
If this is an actual threat and results in something like the lockdown we saw in 2020, the market will get fried like never before because of the amount of leverage. Also, rates are very low already, so the fed has no ammunition to support the economy. But, hopefully, the variant doesn't spread and isn't as bad as the media is making it out to be.,
"Nu Covid"? Jesus, they aren't even trying anymore are they? Puts it is!,
Is this for real?  

We’ve gotta start blowing this shit off eventually,
Thank God jpow is still in charge. He can work the printers overtime,
Discount SPY on Black Friday ! ;))) I don’t mind!,
PTON is 🤔 

A right call may lead to riches while the wrong one gets you a ticket to Squid Games,
First the return of nu-metal, now this?,

Sounds like more bullshit fear porn,
People need to get back to living life without fear of illness. I’m mentally exhausted over covid-19.,
fuck these new strains everyone i know is over the new covid hype,

I have a put for tomorrow hopefully see some gains to roll out to next week for more puts,
SPY FDIC insured.,
Get weekly puts and then once it’s down get call leaps, looking at AMZN, SHOP, NVDA, AMD, FB,
Lolol, finally used up some of me dry powder to restart my TD position and buy some shitcoins on the side, was one day early 🤣🤣🤣🤣,
I smell WHO bullshit. This why we all must get a 3rd jab... and must all lock down again. And must all get the 4th jab in the spring...,

Chill tf out.. its not even down 1 full percent yet for the spy futures,
Down -1.7% right on TradingView, to everyone saying it’s not even 1%… I’m excited for the Black Friday sale

Puts? Or buy the dip?,
Black Friday discunts for all!,
Time to recover from my early week YOLO on $ISPC!,
It will be just a market correction.,
We always have to blame something when we don't make money. Truth is there doesn't have to be a reason other than someone else wanted that money more than you did.,

Are DJ/SPX/NQ gonna reach -4% today, or is the drop already priced in?,
I remember the covid 2.0 guy who has puts on zoom lmao,
Fuck it I'll say what everyone wants to. I'm switching to team Covid now because humans suck and I need my puts to print. Let nature kill off the weak, fat and stupid. Whoever gets the jab and starts having retard babies can fuck off too.,
South Africa buying puts before telling world about new variant.. Complete insider trading.. Where is SEC (SUCK E DICK). 🚀,
People are going to be so pissed about “Nu Covid” they’re going to have to bring in “Covid Classic” to quell the masses.,
Line up boys it’s boost season,
Stfu about covid holy fuck, the flu was renamed and media went crazy,

Soon we'll all be trillionairs!,
i hate this picture so much.,
Remember, these people get to vote same way as you.,
These people are more retarded than I am. Just give everyone 1 million fuck it.,
Y'all love the printer but even with the printer on all you retards are losing money.

Imagine when the printer turns off.

You all gonna live behind the Wendy's, not just work behind it,
I can collect water with rocks and plastic. I can make shelter. I can make fire with 2 sticks and a string. I will eat bugs. 
Bring on the inflation and then hopefully the invasion or nukes,
All perfect Dunning-Kruger examples.,
Looks like suitable Daddy Powell's successors to me,
Holy shit these people are morons. Its honestly interesting that these people can even survive daily life.,
I don’t see the problem. Just add a few zeroes at the end of account balance when it gets low and, bam! Infinite munnies

What could possibly go wrong?,
if you keep the money at the top the only price inflation will be lambos yahts art caviar filet mignon if it gets to the bottom watch out better buy crypto,
Wait... All these people are business major? It all make sense now 💀,
Can we all mail these people a 100 Trillion Dollar Zimbabwean note and ask them to try and buy a Coke with it over there?,
Just print baby print,
I am really confused by all the criticism here??????? Usually these are the comments I see on this very sub....

It is really getting hard to tell who's who....

Dare I click on the next post and contrast??????,
Erdogan tried copying the FED but it’s not working for them. Turkey needs to appoint Bernanke to run their CB.,
U all fell for the bait lmao,
It really speaks to the average iq of this sub that the sarcasm of the comments in the pictures (aside from the third one, I think they're genuinely retarded) is going over everyone's heads. 😅,
These people for chairman and Vice Chairman once papa Powell’s second term is up,
Inflation is real. The “Why” is what is people should be talking about more,
Oh? You say inflation is a consequence? Well I choose to just ignore it. Checkmate, money nerds.,
So, just change the timeless fundamentals of individual and collective human behavior and interaction on both the conscious and subconscious levels. Piece of cake.,
Everyone is taking this extremely seriously but it really feels like these people are just being sarcastic, especially with that last comment,
Steal from the rich. The rich just simply raises prices. Simple economics. Retards.,
Retards : Reality can be whatever I Want,
If usa can just print infinite amount of money, what's point of taxes? Since usa can print it.,
FIAT currency and central banks really do be ruining economic systems based on scarcity and limited time.,
Inflation is real but the debt is meaningless.,
Rules are fucking emergent. dumasses,
Send these retards to venezuela for a week,
these are youtube comments, what do you expect to find? nobel laureates? youtube comments are consistently on par with yahoo answers as far as intelligence goes.,
Let’s try it this way. Let’s say there is only one porno in the world and it only exists in the form of a VHS. How much money would you be willing to pay for that tape and a VHS player?


Now let’s think about how easy it is to access porn today. How much would you pay for a VHS player and that same tape today?,
Obligatory iNflAtiON iS TrAnsItORy,
It’s true though. The economy is made up. It’s all human fugazi. No law of nature dictates anything.,
The question is how you get to real money from currency.  Since the answer is inflation I would have to agree with the commenters.

Print more,
If one more of these greasy pink-haired troglodytes tells me that the economy isn’t real I’m going to completely loose my shit,
Inflation is up 6% and people are losing their shit, where was this last year when things were deflating? Deflation is worse then inflation..

Inflation is also a sigh of economic growth…would anyone here be happy with stagnant growth with 2% inflation?

“In many cases, deflation proves more harmful to an economy than inflation. It is because interest rates can only be lowered to zero. It means people get less for their investments in banks and other income securities. They spend less that causes lower production. Eventually, the economy slows down and can lead to an economic recession.”,
Wow and apparently we're the retarded ones.,
What has wallstreetbets turned into? Seems like the same fake/Russian accounts that tried to influence boomers using social media.

Seems like every post is political with no substance.,
Leftist moment,
Funny how billionares can hoard wealth without it affecting the economy, trillions bailing out banks and it doesnt affect the economy, but suddenly giving everyone 1200$, less than one whole jeff bezos to the us goverment, makes the economy nosedive.

Its all made up, these numbers arent real.,
"so many angry business majors"

Econ majors are arts and sciences.

Yes I'm in accounting 

Goodbyeeee,
Everyone on the internet is an expert,
I honestly struggle with the concept of inflation. I guess it's greed that will result in prices rising if we just gave everyone a million dollars, but imagine giving anyone a million and not allowing prices for goods to change, what would happen then?,
When WSB doesn't recognize sarcasm.,
Theyre technically correct but it would take everyone being on board which will happen precisely......  never.,
We absolutely literally could just print more money and give it to poor people. Sure prices would inflate but the poor would be in a better position than they were before. The 80 IQ retards on this fucking forum make it sound like if you give people stimulus checks somehow prices would inflate even BEYOND the additional purchasing power granted by those checks. How the fuck does that make any sense to you? That’s not how the market fucking works retards. 

If they doubled the wage of workers at chipotle the prices of the menu items (and everything else) would not then fucking double. They would go up a little but overall the chipotle workers still have higher purchasing power than they did prior. If you say gave free 10k checks to the bottom 95% of Americans. Yes there would be massive inflation BUT the only people whose real purchasing power would actually go down are the top 5% (the ones who did not receive the checks). And fuck those guys. Giving someone free money is never going to fucking LOWER their purchasing power you fucking idiots.,
Clearly no one subscribed to WSB knows about a resource based economic model, an automated economy, or a steady-state economic model. All socioeconomic systems become obsolete eventually, and that will inevitably, someday, include a scarcity based resource-distribution/human-governed system like trade, barter, and capitalism.,
People need to stop blaming Jerome Powell and blame the left for continuing to dump money into peoples hands on top of what Powell is doing.,
Ah, women.,
Fucking Grinch ass face lol love it,
Never thought Jerome would be the type to have burner accounts, yet here we are lol,
I feel like we are bagholding people, time to cut some of the losses. Every time I feel we reached the bottom, it dips again.,
“i LoVe BiG bRoThEr!!”,
When will be the next fed meeting regarding tapering?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Purge movies looking a little more reasonable atm,
Yes.,
Powell turns into jokar,
Inflation is only transitory in the sense that all life is transitory.

As long as you're still around, you can expect inflation to not go away again.,
if Elon Musk gave everyone 1bn dollars he would still have 145bn dollars left. But he refuses!,
I mean, all of society is "made up." Just because it's made up doesn't mean things are going to suck once it collapses.,
Maybe if every country in the world did this?,
[removed],
I mean QE is basically what they're saying the comments. Print money but so long as it is kept away from metrics monitored by CBI and other measures of inflation its all good.,
This is WSB's in a nut shell!,
I now realize this sub isn’t actually the stupid people. Sure we are in debt from investing in meme stocks but at least we acknowledge the debt exists,
These comments must be by GME holders,
We need an iq test requirement to vote,
Why does no one want to admit that we have to have a class system in this country for the economy to work. Give the poor money then raising prices is a net of zero. The poor will always be poor. And if you don’t want to be poor anymore, get a better job.,
So basically these women are saying that the economy is like emotional labor - just made up bullshit?,
If only i had the epic super power that white girls have: the ability to think you know best and ignore everyone who is more educated on the subject than you are.,
If inflation not real, how come my peepee inflate when I look naked lady parts?,
My sister is one of these monsters,
Holy shit you guys are retarded woooosh dude,
“Mom don’t forget my almond milk”
-tiktoker 


“Fucking almond milk, who tf she thinks she is.  That shit is getting more expensive every visit”. 
-her mom,
Print more money that has always worked so well.,
What if Elon rocket misses that asteroid  coming straight to us?   Puts on Tesla?,
$SENS👀,
Huh?,
At least we will be millionaire.,
Why is it that it is always the dumbest people that are the loudest lol. If I was this retarded, I wouldn't be in a rush to let everyone know, but again I'm just mildly retarded.,
"Democracy basically means goverment by the people, of the people, for the people.. but the people are retarded",
If everything goes up in prices, including wages... Is it even inflation?,
Business major or not: It IS a fact that if we printed more money and EVERYONE simply agreed NOT to raise the prices because of it, we could technically just avoid inflation.

The issue is getting everyone to agree.

All it’d take us one bad apple ruining the bunch by raising prices,
I mean, actual paper money used to just be a stand-in for gold currency you owned, and then one day, they just said, "Your paper money has no value beyond what we give it. looooooool".,
Inflation is great for people with asset debt. My property has more than paid for it's interest rate with inflation.😅,
keep the printers alive this is how we do it we will be ultra rich in no time,
The fact that these people can vote is concerning.,
this picture makes me want to paint the wall with my head,
everyone’s finally becoming self aware good job 👏,
$300 hookers demanding $400,
It’s not real if your wealthy,
Inflation is good to promote economic growth tho. Too high for long periods is bad but we're not there yet,
Inflation is caused purely by rich people hoarding their money. Supply chain troubles just exposed it.,
We as a species evolved for ten thousand years, invented a way to exchange information using one of the foundimental aspects of the universe just to give these people a way to share their brain online.


Can't wait for the nuclear war. Someone call Russia or China to nuke us. Please.,
“There are so many angry business majors here this is hilarious.” It’ll also be hilarious when your parents don’t have any food to put on the table.,
#Transitory  you snitches!,
SEARCH MINERALS,
Damn. Are humans doomed to repeat history again?,
The laws of economics are observed truths. 
The rules of economics exist to prevent stupid people from doing harm out of ignorance of the behavior of those laws.,
"There are so many angry business majors here"

What % of this sub does this apply to?,
It actually isn't but ok? What has the government done for the people that has caused them to print money? Oh wait nothing. They're just printing money to artificially make things more expensive so the proles buy less stuff.,
The economy is as real as we make it,
Thats what Octavian thought too.,
Learn how to hunt and field butcher an animal.,
So all these people will sell me all their belongings for a bag of dirt since scarcity doesn’t impact value,
Remember kids everyone is a billionaire in Venezuela 🤪,
Someone quick let these people know they are in the running for dumbest comments of all time,
Please my friends tread carefully on TikTok, there is a brain aids virus going around I heard. It’s sad :(,
Calm your farm… this will go away in the next year or two …. Way too much FUD about this.

Media is loving the doom story… princess are up in the short term but capitalism and rising interest rates next year will bring us back to normal.,
[removed],
Per my latest data Inflation will be at least 7% across the board in 2022 budget accordingly!,
All credit should be wiped clean and everything should start over from 0 if we can adjust the economic rules,
The idiotic train of thought.... boils my blood.,
I remember back in the day seeing those million dollar bills that 3rd world countries used to buy bread. Here we come! These retards literally don't understand that having a finite amount of something makes something valuable.,
Clown!,
We don’t have the level of automation required for everyone to be trillionaires sadly,
We are going to be the next boomers and I’m ok with that,
I guess they’ve never heard of Venezuela?,
Your home can appreciate from 30K to 3M in 10-20 years in government’s eye,,, in reality you are f***d. No one tell you the truth, in real world it is your money depreciating in value, you feel the pain when you pay 3K per month for your property taxes in Texas, after your property is paid off. You have to sell your home anyway, since you can’t pay the property taxes anymore while it is paid off, since the Social Security only pay you $1,500 per month, assuming you can keep paying your mortgage for 30 years. You really paid triple or quadruple price of your home to IRS based on appreciation of your home, which is not real and they do not consider depreciation of your buying power.,
I will just buy more $MMAT and $TMC,
True,
Anyone add in the fact that automation will cause deflation? So intentional inflation only neutralizes our exponential growth towards automation.,
Biden is nobody who is inflating and running gas price up who the fuck is playing America ?,
Inflation is under my bed,
Average Brandon supporters.,
This hurt to read,
Statistically, inflation doesn’t exist,
Can I hold it in my hand? Can I see it with my eyes?,
I can’t wait to be a citizen of the United States of Zimbabwe.,
Inflation isn't real, the bills still read 1, not 0.94. Checkmate economists.,
Let’s put a smile on that face everybody, when things get bad sometimes it helps to flip it all upside down,
Phase out nonessential business. Initiate non tax barter system. Actually tax the rich. Allocate taxes properly. Free Wi-Fi everywhere. Decrease social economic gap. Nobody will say it but these issues we face stem from materialism. Learn to live through real relationships and not the things you own. Socialism is paradise.,
It’s sad when wsb members are smarter than the average citizen,
If I hear one more person try to tell me inflation is transitory,

Nio calls 900k gain wtf,
all that is vaporising tonight,
Bro I am so sorry in advance,
I think these will print VERY well in the next 3-4 months. NIO catalyst:  Nov/Dec deliveries, NIO Day December 18th, Progress on NEO Park completion, ET7 numbers and announcement of ET5, new partnerships Shell stations, expansions into Europe.  Goodluck but seems like you don't need it,
Can you record yourself as market opens today?? I want a new guh video,
Don't turn on the news bro 😆,
3 dollar calls you animal,
Good luck. China just asked $DIDI to delist. Feel free to Google it.,
which institution brought $3 call for nio in 2021? or is that from 1921?,
This is going to age well!,
Looks like Robinhood did you a favor after all. Now do yourself a favor and sell this shit asap. Don't be a greedy tard. China is looking mighty dangerous right now,
Until Xi does something to appease the people. You’ve been warned,
Oh man ur screwed,
didi collateral damage,
I’m curious as to how much those 3 dollar calls cost you.  But congratulations to you sir and your unrealized fuck you money.,
Rest In Peace,
So, based on this and your comments, you're betting that they won't be shut down so they can map out invasion plans for the Chinese?,
Amazing man.  Great job.  You should be retiring soon.,
Ouch...just sell at open no matter what that voice inside your head tells you. just do it or regret later.,
Luuuul,
Damn nice play congrats,
Same but mine are all red.,
Fuck man, learn to take profits brother, this is gonna be nasty tomorrow,
Your are so fucked tomorrow. Get out why you can China is about to force all stocks to either delist and move to the Hong Kong exchange or else,
Take profits when you 50x ur investment retard,
LOL,
GUH,
Still using RH. Rich and braindead. Balance in all...,
Lol everyone in here talking like his position sucks because of the most recent news when they're actually envious some dude made over a million dollars from options. 

Grow a pair and buy and hold.,
 Dont open your portfolio in the morning. Your about to change your flair to 
"50k-> 5k big dicked by xi Jinping ",
JFC??!?!?!!?,
insane gains,
If they are mooning then so will BlackBerry!!!! That shit's in everything!!!!,
GUHH,
I would sell half in December to split my tax liability into multiple years (and also take a safe gain while I have it).,
You’re a mad man.,
More Covid lockdowns. New strain. No one driving. No one buying. 

I would take profit. But I would love to see these explode higher or turn deep negative. One of the two.,
Be sure to take profits.,
Well the money printer is ducking red hot so send it,
Nio 3c, wow!!,
unzips pants\*,
Not touching chinese stocks,
F,
finally a nio post which didn't get downvoted. lets start the nio train again. lfg,
Never trust CCP and their boi Xi.,
If these are Chinese companies I do not want them.

Not happening for any reason. I am not buying Chinese-(owned) companies.,
Spy opening green or red tomorrow?,
“Up 889k” “ will hold until the next 3-4 months”🤡 this is why retail stays poor my friend,
This thread reeks of Chinese propaganda.,
How the fuck do I do this, like what YouTube tutorial do I watch to figure this shit out,
Based. Too little love for Chinese EVs on this board considering their promise,
Holy fucking shit.

Beautiful gains. I swear WSB man, people are gaining and losing quite a couple 100k's  like its no biggie. That's a lot of money for me,
Whinnie the pooh gonna ass fuck that honey hole you call a portfolio,
Show me percentages,
Wow when did you purchase these options?,
Or, sell some, retire, pay off your 250k home, 30k car, put your 2.5 kids through college, and have fuck you money for the rest of your life....,
🤮🤮🤮,
SEARCH MINERALS,
I’m getting out xpev I the low 60’s. Better stocks out ther tbh,
I fucking agree with this statement. XPEV is going to rally harder tho. XPEV is hitting an Elliot wave 3 VS NIO hitting an Elliot wave 5.,
What kind of options are the last two?,
Don’t forget Li Auto,
very cool dude. I am a large nio bag holder. Been holding since 2020. Where do you see the stock EOY and 2023?,
XPEV is like printing money! Will hit $60 tomorrow.,
Nio mün baby,
Xi : Me bout to fuk yo entire career ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

In all seriousness gl brother, at least some of us need to take profits in China bets,
Holding 100 shares of each. In these two for the long haul.,
What made you pull the trigger on this play?,
Can we get an update on all that green after all the red we have seen today,
Man I wish I knew how calls work.
Or find a site that actually tells me how it works for real,
Guhhhh,
Selllllll you retard!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
When did you buy the NIO $3 strike calls?,
BB $25....WISH $20,
Now this guy is an inside trader !,
What do you think about the Jan '24 $55?,
Sorry but TA says nio gonna test 15$ next year,
Fuck I need this type of money,
[deleted],
*laughs in China's failing economy*,
NIO is so 2020 lol,

My Canadian $BB family. <3 Higher lows on the weekly chart. Bullish divergence on weekly momentum and the daily chart head and shoulders is such good bait to kill some shorts. It’s an inverse head and shoulders that could possibly print in the weekly. This is going to be a legendary bull vs bear battle on the $10.50 break in the US.,

CRAMER YOU STILL BUYING THIS HAND OVER FIST?,
But Jim Cramer say we should load up? Fuck u Cramer u got me again.🤣,
So it’s either 14$ or zero tomorrow. Nice.,
Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said.,
How fucked am I as a BABA holder ,are we hitting 90 tomorrow, my cb is 180 so I am fucked, fuck man.,
Simple, stop investing in commie stocks,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
If they say no, the ccp will fuck them over,
>Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.’s top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request that’s likely to revive fears about Beijing’s intentions for its giant tech industry.

>The country’s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. 

>Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close.

>Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.

>Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.

>Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July.

>It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. 

>Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.

>Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.

>Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.

>Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.

>A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. 

>Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.

>It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.,
oh boy didi just did baba dirrrrty

game over Baba....tmr it's going to bleed,
Investors in Didi and Wish are not having a nice Thanksgiving holiday.... 📉,
China using "security concerns" as a reason, lol.,
Red Friday…the streets will fill with  blood and the CCP flag will rise once again. 

Good luck my brothers and sisters…see you on the battlefield.,
China asking a company to do something totally different than US doing so, this is an order not a request. US didi bag holders are screwed.,
They're not asking. They're telling.,
Chinese stocks seem to be a woman. Nearly regular periods of bleeding with ups in between,
Next will be NIO and XPEV citing National Security. 
Chinese stocks have become toxic.,

Hey China is only asking. Didi can say no.,
All helps IONQ even more 🤑,
[removed],
Feel like this will be a Luckin Coffee situation. Drops to sub $1, now sitting at $13-15.,
👀,
In case of delisting what will happen? My shares will go to 0? I’ll lost everything?,
How does this affect UBER?,
I think Chinese stock should list in Hongkong or mainland China just to appease Emperor Xi.,
Puts on UBER,
China wants to control capital outflows.,
“Ask”,
"You can't delist us.  We quit!"

<Face-saving achieved>,
Nice! I’m gonna re-up on those tomorrow,

All that and you made $1300?,
Wait stocks go up?,
There's still a chance to get out with a modest gain... just remember that.,
Good timing. I bought last month and I’m down 40%.,
Why?,
This is one volatile mofo. It was in the mid 70s not too long ago.,
Here I am saving my Life's Gamblings for a secure future, and you come by to flip the script. I applaud your daring and unprecedented moves which have surely never before been reproduced on this subreddit.

Comrad, I salute you!
💎👐🚀🌙🐒🤝💪🤪🤮😢🤣😄😎🍆💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦🥂,
Wait wtf, Dutch pros is public!? Damn I’d have invested in them. They’re everywhere I used to live.,
All I have to say is that where I live they finally built a Dutch bros and it’s Texas so that’s a rare thing and the place has a line wrapped around it all the time. I also like their coffee better than Starbucks.,
valhalla is waiting,
Dutch Mafia represent!,
i would rather invest in Bang Bros.,
By next year it's share value will be over $100 it literally went from open at 33 to 46 to 80 in a month an half,  huge potential but it's not gme or amc so no one cares about it,
The P.E. ratio is a little high. Good luck🍀,
Why there is no expiration date?,
That’s not a lot of profit, considering how much you put in.,
This is not a yolo retard,
nice entry. hope this works for you

it’s being pushed down by rising coffee prices for now,
Only lose if you sell broooo,
I like this. Dutch is king here in Phoenix. Keep buying,
Even though Dutch Bros coffee quality is mediocre at best and their employees/culture is obnoxious, the PNW can’t get enough of it. Not a terrible idea to go long on it. Godspeed,
Not sure YOLOing all of your life savings on anything (thank god its at least not options) is a great idea for a market noob in any scenario. With that being said, welcome to WSB you are a true retard🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍,
That’ll hurt today at open,
Say goodbye to that green today and congrats you fit in perfectly here now,
Guessing you’re young.  If you lose it you have time to replace it.,
What even is dutch bros,
Sorry bro we don’t use Robinghood around here,
Anybody else think it's weird people put that much money in a Robinhood account? Like why not use a real firm with real benefits.

I think it's a great app for starting and learning. And great to be able to buy pieces of the pie, but the benefits/experience I get from Schwab is just vastly superior,
If you’re gonna gamble your life savings on a whim why are you buying a company that sells shitty coffee ?,
Nice,
Sweet Gainz .. LOL,
I got hired at dutch bros the day after they went live. 1 day earlier and I would have gotten free stock 🥲,
I love Dutch bros personally and think long term this is a good buy. Short term I think it dips a bit more.,
oh sheeeet

i mis read it as threw entire life savings at Dutch hos...

sigh... i need to stop drinking....,
Honestly I can see dutch bros making it long term, expect alot of volatility in the short term. Small position myself.,
I had a dream BROS hit $100 per share the other week,
When did Dutch bros go public?!?!,
Dutch mafia or whatever,
You were 1 away from having 69% battery,
Good thing you're all caught up,
I literally got sideswiped from a 16 year old in a Prius outside of a dutch bros. Not sure how those affects the stock but it sucked.,
You watch mad money with Jim Cramer don’t u,
The Dutch Brothers started in my area and I can verify their stores are constantly busy. Especially when compared to Starbucks etc. Just drove by one less than 2 hours ago and there were at least 8 cars lined up for coffee. 

You may have a solid one here.,
2.58% gain.  might as well just post loss porn,
I've never seen a more obvious put play than when it ran up to 450+ p/e before earnings 😂,
Pull out before your wife's boyfriend wants you gone!!,
And what catalyst are you expecting here to make the share price move? Will there be some sort of embargo on energy drinks or do you just think it’s undervalued?,
Should’ve put it all on GME.,
Oh man. Black Friday gonna be painful for you bros. You’ll be in my prayers,
I grew up where DB is from. Visiting right now for the holidays. Honestly I think I'm going to move back here.,
Lol what a risk.,
Of all the seemingly endless ways you could have invested that money, you did that.,
That's foolish,
Sometimes i feel like living in the US would really help my investing outlook.

So many good stocks and companies that are apparently popular but i have never heard of them or seen them because i live in a wet island , gang banged by shitty Costa coffees from all sides.,
You must really like sugar with your mediocre coffee. Idk what the appeal of dutch is when there are so many good coffee places in the PNW,
I mean how isn't a regional coffee company worth $2b? Seems like a steal,
Shares???! Get fucked peasant,

I would say congrats but you failed to make a 1,000% return so I'll just say Fuck You and Happy Thanksgiving.,
Now that's buying the dip, well done.,
Hertz💪,
This hertz my feelings.,
Ah very nice your average is where I sold. Thanks for the reminder,
Make it HERTZ(HTZ),
My mom did the same thing.  She's still holding tho,
I bought HTZZ at $36. It Hertz now. Bad.,
Congrats on getting some ketchup with them nuggets.,
OTC ? Good luck realizing that price,
Been holding for a while. It’s going to the moon when people find out how undervalued it is and aren’t scared of the red tape. In the mean time, buying every single dip I see.,

The pictures are cool, I like how they have green in them, not a huge fan of the red though,
you're oldschool, you actually posted positions. last time I read positions or ban was pre gme influx,
So Disney calls?,
Had to buy a new monitor because from all the other posts my screen is all marker now,
So think this is a mark over reaction to new covid coming out of SA or could we be looking to go into a bear market?,
So……..Red Dildos?,
I can’t read someone tell me if this aged well.,

my corn stocks are still down 🥴,
Have you checked the after market,
Do I have news for you,
Gourds,
I would love to see your face, looking at the market today :D,
Corner the market in FCOJ. Surest path to untold riches! 

-- Randolph & Mortimer Duke,
Its green in Canada. We the US to stay a few more days away from the casino,
You caused a whole Nu covid strain... hope you're happy =/,
This did not hold up well,
Turn the graph upside down,
Calm before the storm.,
Short answer: No

&#x200B;

Long answer: Noooo,
My options are down cus of theta,
I honestly thought that everybody in this forum were seasoned investors with millions in their pockets!,
Tax man will make it bleed red fast,
Wait for it retard,
Yes, expect huge profit son. Your 1 dollar will turn into 2 dollar, so enjoy buying 2 stuff from 1 dollar store.,
I had same feelings, but today I blame myself that I not sold everything,
Guys I think my app is glitchy, showing red instead of green. I'll turn it off and on again next week.,
I wish mods could ban for such a shit joke.,
Yes, stand towards north and keep praying,
Sell and buy something even more retarded....   AND HODL!,
Celebrate every win, my friend,
 Canadian here.  Happy Thanksgiving.  My TSX stocks were up 1.3% in the green...for that, I am thankful!,
There’s no trading because it’s Thanksgiving?,
Turns out when your call options expire worthless your balance just goes to $0 and you have a 0% return everyday. This is the best return I’ve ever got so I continue to buy way out of the money call options, see red returns for 5 days, then celebrate when I see a 0% return.,
no, it means it'll go back down.  sell everything when you're in the positive and buy them back when they dip,
Calm before the storm my brother,
I am afraid the new South African variant will turn it 180 straight down again today...,
Rekt,

I've never heard of any of these, but it sounds like all these are at all time lows. Buy now, literally can't go tits up.,
In the original spirit of wsb, those tickers are what this sub is for. About to get delisted/filed chapter 11 but the stock still goes toinks like hard on dick. True meme stocks.,
The Great Delisting of China, some say it can even be seen from space.,
On the brink = 6 months.

SNDL is a bigger concern for this sub.,
Luokung Technology  didn't make it back on the list🥳🥳🥳,
There is a company called Weidai? Seriously, who didn't see this company meeting its end??,
Planet green holdings has seen a 98% loss since listing. This seems like a great opportunity to buy the dip. I am going to gather up the wish/clov/sdc crowd and we are gonna fuck the hedges by squeezing this hidden gem. 😉

Buy the dip 🙄,
The Great Dip Forward,
Until whinnie the pooh calms his communist dick down, I wouldn't touch anything china related with a 10 foot clown pole,
Time to buy,
This should have been already done…they operate through a absolute scam called vie structure, investors don’t actually own the company, they own a shell company based in cayman island which btw isn’t even legal..ccp has never said vie’s are legal. they don’t want their financials audited. There is a reason why every fucking chinese company looks undervalued on paper, most of their financials are cooked up.,
“Anotha one”,
Also about people realizing they don't own any actual shares in said companies, they own shares in some Cayman subsidiary that gives them rights to shares. Not the same thing as owning actual shares.,
You forgot no.26 $BABA,
Going all-in Monday, thanks for the advice.,
Good, get rid all all their shit,
They don’t want the financial statements to be checked. They don’t want this, they don’t want that. They just want the money.

China should just stick to their principles. Support local! List in Chinese stock exchanges!,
Anyone has a dd on which of these are worth trying my luck?,
And some how China Jojo drugstores remains off the list.,
$Tigr is safe from that, amen, We can stop the FuD now and go back to a normal price of 25$,
What happens to puts for a stock that gets delisted?,
Who would actually invest any money in a Chinese company?,
Good. Fuck them!,
I'm going  take a loot at that list. There is going  be lot of bankrupt garbage  but maybe  few viable companies  where I wouldn't mind take a small bet in there prices.,
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.asiafinancial.com/chinese-stocks-delisted) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> There are 248 Chinese companies with a combined market capitalisation of about $2.1 trillion that face delisting from US markets within a three-year timeframe if they fail to comply with US audit norms that Congress has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce.

> &quot;We don&#039;t think that delisting of Chinese firms from the US market is a good thing either for the companies, for global investors or Chinese-US relations,&quot; Shen Bing, director general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission&#039;s department of international affairs, told a conference in Hong Kong.

> So any compromise reached between senior leaders or regulators in the US and China must comply with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board&#039;s audit requests, and the US Congress would have to act to stop delisting.

Why dont they take out a 0% loan and buy back 50% of their stock. The share price will rocket and then they can sell at a profit.

It worked for Amazon, Tesla, Hertz ...,

Just stating facts,
nuke them all,
Easy. Just do reverse splits by 1000x. Then you are safe.,

Hey /u/William_de_Wealth, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
You guys are researching before buying?,
We can go to dollar tree and buy whatever you like,
I think the market is on sale too!,
Fk I clicked the post after seeing black and thinking it’s a BB DD. Must have been thinking about buying the BB dip at open…

Anyway, $BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀,
Your list of examples is super biased

Sony due to PS4/5? Last I heard nobody can buy them even 1y after release.

Vans? lol you must have been a poor skater child in the 90s

Pandora..  Pandora!? Wishful thinking,
Sears,
VFC is a sideways stock, get that mess outta here,

Ironically, they happen to also be the most shorted companies on any exchange. Nvidia is a new adddition, but where is the SPY, AMZN and TQQQ?,
What is this company that sells apples? There was no description, do you expect my smooth brain to know ALL the companies???,
U forgot GME bro and wish lol

Trust me bro,
SOFI 💙 🤍,
>Btw, $NVDA shares bounced back today from their mini sell-off - it happened after Nvidia crushed Wall Street's expectations when it released its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on November 17th, 

Bro you are already predicting next year results, nice!

"Downfall of Star Hedge Fund" =>  overleveraged HF jacked to the tits on a Central Bank sponsored bull run.

As long as it works out = genius.

And as I'm already at it: Nasdaq down -2%. 

I bet some "new generation" Hedge Fund managers are curling up in some dark corner. 

I wonder how many Hedge Funds blow up this time when we reach at least -30%.,
Spoiler alert

Every country is having the same problem,

*closes all black friday deals tabs*,
Jesus I figured after all this time you morons would realize that futures don't matter until 930 est. Last time we had a big covid scare dow went from -600 to +200 by open.

Calm your tits, go jerk off a couple times and take some fucking ambien.,
Be courteous to your coke dealer and get your drugs early so they can spend time with their families too.,
to anyone who is stoned / drunk & gaming rn I salute u,

My broker called and said their was something really wrong with my margarine. I said I only use real butter and hung up.,

#Representin all of us who have to spend this Thanksgiving alone 

My local VFW is giving away free plates and you even get to make your own plate instead of just grabbing from a stack. Eat in or take out. I love Maine,
so, every single person that "invests" or trades now adays is constantly checking their phone every second of the day.  get the fuck out of here with "i only check every once in a while" bullshit

given the above fact, there's no fucking excuse why the casino is not open 100% of the time

the excuse of "what of the market takes a shit while you're sleeping" is INVALID and NULLIFIED by the ft that the market does many times take a shit while it's closed, anyone here ever heard of a Gap Down?

so get the fuck out of here with the excuses and keep the casino open 24 hr/day 7 days/week 365 days/year

the Vegas way baby,
I remember one Thanksgiving I farted super hard at the dinner table and my mom started crying and saying ‘why are you like this’ then my dad used the belt on me and I played Goldeneye before I went to bed. I miss being a kid,
Bears celebrating their puts going from -99% to -98%.,
Last time this thread was this bearish, SPY opened like +1%,
Covid gonna be here until we all die. Ridiculous absolutely stupid as shit. Vaxxed or not vaxxed it doesn’t matter. Fuck COVID fuck covid fuck covid,
y'know what else has mutations?

>!deez nuts!<,
The worst part about red days isn't losing money, it's reading bear comments by guys who've been wrong for a month straight and finally get a put to hit,
Volunteered to work for double pay today so I will have more money to lose next week.,

*dip happens*.  

Is this the crash,
Nikkei just bounced off -3% and is up to -2.94%.  Stock market crash is cancelled!,
Was at 36k last week and I will be under $1,000 tomorrow :),
Who else spending today alone,
My best friend's daughter is three years old.  She wants Barbies and nothing but Barbies for Christmas.  So I talk to my best friend and I say, are you sure you want her to have Barbies at her age?  She says yeah it's fine, Barbie is "normal" now.  So I say ok, Barbie it is.  Google Barbie on Amazon, and I get a link that shows me the difference between old Barbie and new Barbie.  Old Barbie is tall and skinny.  New Barbie has a fucking dump truck ass (as far as white girls go).  What an age we live in.,
Had a friend who took his money out when he first heard about Covid in 02/20. His portfolio of cash did better for a month… I don’t know anything about this new variant, but I’m just saying we been at this for 2 years and we had 2 amazing years of bull run powered by tech stocks. I’ll take my chances 

Also a little fishy that the news drops the day before thanksgiving from the organization (WHO) who is advocating that everyone need to mask up and act like they are unvaccinated regardless of vaccination status but is against countries providing their population with boaster shots. God I hate how everyone has turned COVID into a political weapon.,
I’m getting tired of all these new strains of COVID,
tomorrow: markets rally as they remember they dont give a fuck about covid,
I trade futures. I bought what I thought was the dip.

^(It was not the dip),
If this dip is really because of concern over a new variant then futures traders are the dumbest people alive,
this is mega bullish. now Jay powell has an excuse to cancel taper, cancel rate hikes and pump our asses with more QEEEEEE. more stimmy checks too 🤑,
What the hell am I supposed to do today?,

So let’s get the facts here. Majority of cases of new variant are in South Africa, that we know of so far. It is heavily mutated, but also spreading in a country with a vax rate of only 24%. They do not know the degree to which current vaccines work against the new strain. My state is damn near 70% vaxxed… if there is still efficacy in the current vaccines to the new strain, I like my odds. That’s a big unknown heading into the weekend tho,

lol fuckin uncle keeps bragging a out his cooking like “man you guys are missing out on my BBQ chicken, I make sure to evenly grill it on both sides just enough to keep the moisture and put on the special secret sauce, you remember don’t you daryl?” 

Like if u gonna brag about your cooking skills why didn’t you make anything for the family fuckin parasite,
I get it now.  Red futures is just the blood rushing to the hulking green dildo.,

It was hard to explain to Grandma that we lost most of her money, but I think she get's it. Telehealth is the future.,

I genuinely believe most of the inflation scare is orchestrated by the media to enable companies to raise prices. Natural gas isnt near 2008 all time highs and eversource raised electricity prices by 20% and people wont bitch cause of the media narrative.

Also people simply cannot afford to sustain higher prices UNLESS infinite unemployment/benefits are passed.

Interest rates will remain at zero. Earnings expectations are FAR FAAAR too high. End of TED talk,

Did the DOW drop a N bomb at the dinner table or something ?,
Imagine how many people are going to eagerly buy the dip tomorrow during premarket, ATH by eod tomorrow,
lol big money literally pulled a fast one on you, stealing all your money while you're sleeping off the turkey before a half day friday,
I'm not sure if I can weather another 12 hour recession.,

People. Futures are 🌈 and fake. The fuck is wrong with you people?,
Futures will either be up 2% at open or down 5%. No in between.,
DO NOT OPEN THE CASINO ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
So drunk rn. Raise a glass to the wage slaves who have to go into work tmrw.,
There's no reason to panic. Just sell all of your futures contracts very calmly.,
I’m just glad I always keep .04% cash on hand,
Honestly I'm really tempted to throw a rack at Monday spy calls moderatley otm if we just continue to drill tomorrow.,
Wow. It was all for shits and giggles from me before, but this is starting to look serious.,

people are really retarded and have no idea how monetary or even fiscal policy works.,
I know I can make back my 13K with close to the money spy calls easy but the fucking dopamine hit when your deep OTM spy is 26,000% is unbreakable,
Fuck didn’t wake up till 10 am, hangover af, this damn turkey won’t be ready till late afternoon:) Cheers 🥂,
It would be appropriate for WISH to fall 10% on a day when the market is closed.,
We have holidays around overeating, overdrinking, blowing shit up....but we don't have a holiday where we just have an orgy as a country. That's what America is missing.,
It was on Thanksgiving long weekend last yr that everyone was pumping pltr.

My cousin told me he made bank by buying and selling pixelated jpegs. He asked me what options were and how I was doing.

I'm a PJ trader and I am helping to dump futes AMA,
Futes dumping means a new ATH tomorrow. Buls getting Lambos for the whole family for Christmas. Bers might be able to afford a Daewoo if they cash out at open,
Why does market care about covid again? People dying were bullish,
Have no positions rn. Depending on what we see at 4 AM open I may go long. Have a feeling this is a pump day tmmrw.,
Just common fear tactics by wall street cucks.,
we've gotta go through the whole debt ceiling bullshit again soon,

Gotta love the good old “Happy Thanksgiving” text from the ex 

I’m sure on Christmas I’ll receive another,
If you're confused as to what's going on let me break it down for you. Jpow is willing to raise rates if inflation gets worse which it will and it is. Raising rates is dependent on no covid and employment at a good level. So at this point the Fed has two bad choices, let inflation run or raise before employment numbers are at a good level. Either one is bad for the markets. The new variant just boxed them in even more.,
did we go full circle? New virus fears - more stimmy, stay at home boom, tech up,

Wait...that actually works!!?,
wait u guys dont have porn on ur 2nd monitor?,
If you turn off both, there will be no losses!,
This is so retarded it actually may works,
Bankers ***HATE*** him!,
Can I do this through my phone app?,
But then how do you double your gains?,
i recognize the office as ARK headquarters but cant tell which ARK analyst that is sitting there.,
My secret alpha has been leaked to the masses. Dammit, third monitor it is.,
Here at ARK office we just use a green crayon on our second monitor🖍,
What if you disconnect both monitor? Do you stop losing money? In that case it’s better to cut the power too so you gain money no? Isn’t that how it works?,
I never buy red ambient light for my room. My second monitor is enough,
I stopped using monitors... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
He cuts the loss in half assuming his chart is on log scale.,
Monitor? Lol. RH traders prefer charts without ticks and just push buttons on their phone.,
It is absolutely wonderful to see RH go down the shitter.  Karma is a bitch.,
Talk about disconnecting from reality...

But, does it work?,
Delete app saves a lot,
Clearly one of us!,
Meanwhile taxes cut my profits in half too :/,
Damn. That is why I need two monitors.,
You guys use monitors to trade?,
Idiot. Should have flipped the monitor upside down to make infinite gains.,
Monitor sales spiked on black Friday and retailers are out of stock,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887),
Like any of them have desktops, they are all on their phones.,
Am I on Facebook or is this sub just this shit now?,
I love this,
Anyone know what’s happening with SDC ? I bought in at $5 but it’s at $3 ish rn.,

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT,
that's the invention of the century,
life changing solution,
You can also do this on mobile by only closing one eye when trading on the app.,
A post-it note might help too. Just block that part of the screen.,
 He do know for whenever reason he did 
that brought himself on a brain freeze,
Fact!!!,
What is this, The Wall Street Onion?,
Makes sense. Too much noise. I traded on my brother's computer while out of town and his screen had enough real estate for 4 charts. I had a losing streak my entire visit.,
Waiting to see if some 171221 20P print... Cost basis was .45....,
Literally ANY other stock I’d be all in due to this post. Robbinghoods………………. 😒,
Im gonna throw that 1 monitor i have and run trade in my mind. 


0 monitors = loss reduced by (1/4),
Jon WOOD,
🤣,
😱🤣,
1. Flip monitor upside down. 
2. Invert colors (open Magnifier app, press Ctrl + Alt + I). 
3. 🤑🤑🤑,
I like the graph on the first monitor. May be he should place his bets on upside monitors...that will surely help I think.,
Using my phone only gives the best return,  not joking,
Thats why all my monitors are upside down,
Neat life hack,
Imagine his regrets knowing that he could have bought more monitors to cut even more losses.,
What was a ticket for 11/27 😭🥳,
[removed],
Mods why doesn’t this have DD flair?,
Ah, yes, RobinHood, stealing from the poor to give money to the rich. Seriously...why are you guys still using them after the whole GME cock block?,
How do I do this on my phone?,
*Robbinghood,
The whole appeal of RobinHood is the mobile interface isn't it? This way I can still use my gaming computer (from 2011) for gaming (games from 2013) and watch the Nintendo stock price go up and down. 

(I really hope Legends Arcius generates some hype this December lol),
Given all that greasy business practice, why is anyone still using Robinhood? I've taken out 400k of investment and transferred into Fidelity and Vanguard (for Free). Best decision ever. And I get to speak to customer rep and they are always helpful.,
You’re gonna just repost my meme on here for clout? Lol,
Uninstall the app and reinstall. Poof! No losses existed,
I have to look in to this, I’m on 3 monitors and a tv,
Sound like me when I was trading some internet coins a few years back.,
Fun fact: it works!,
Probably the worst app to use for investing. Same thing with cash app. The analytical information they give you is not good.,
This is what I come to WSB for.,
Wait.. you guys have a monitor and a cell phone!!!,
Quantum mechanics 😩,
Fuck I maxed the Robinhood credit card buying the single ultra wide screen monitor,
Hacks irl,
Would award if I had money instead of stonks,
If you rotate your screen 90°, you'll have more room for growth.,
We need to beat them very hard,
He should sell this strategy to hedgefunds,
Woah. It’s big brain time,
pro gamer move,
didn't they do the "sell the info, but say it was a ?hack? thing?",
Keep the monitor, and disconnect the WIFI.,
Delete the app and cut losses by another 1/3!,
This is fake guys when I turned my second monitor back on the losses were still there,
Where is the lol 😂 emoji,
Exact chart of theta depreciation,
Is this like a TheOnion article?,
You son of a bitch, I’m scared,
If you only make wrong moves, more information just means more wrong moves,
Schrodinger's loss,
So retarded... I've done it.,
Cut your only other monitor off and you don’t lose anything wow,
Turn the left monitor 90° clockwise and watch it go to the moon!,
Even better.  Just turn the monitor upside down and you automatically make more money.,
You all are cracking me up!!! Funniest responses! Love it!,
Sorry I only trade from my phone.,
I love my Robinhood; it depresses me hourly,
hoodinrobin,
The charts on RH are like a video game. No wonder we only see loss porn when a rh account holder posts!,
Damn yall got working monitors?,
That's a pro gamer move,
My Robinhood account is the only one that is green, btw.,
Lol. You beautiful bastards.,
Your lucky. Robinhood came and repossessed my second monitor... Im assuming to give to the poor.,
Problem solved. Easy.,
That graph looks like Monday sour hour ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Does that mean that turning all monitors off will break even?,
This has 40k+ upvotes and makes me hate this sub.

And i'm talking after 5+ years of losing legit money didnt bother me.,
😂😂,
That monitor was the one he had robinhood up on,
Amateur! Try Alt Ctrl Down Arrow and turn your losses into pure STONKSIf this doesn't work you can 'hack' into the computer but right clicking and bring up the display options and 'flip the display' that way... works every time.

Physically flipping your monitor/phone upsidedown also works. Just remember to turn off auto rotate.,
A lot of this is perfect dream logic.,
Wallstreet don't want you to know this one trick.,
Brokers hate this trick!!,
Rob in hood.,
/r/,
I want it,
Tsk tsk newbies still into RH.

Woe to Veterans who had fought the great war of GME in vain,
Coinbase and their “fees” are tantamount to robbery,
You only lose when you sell. When hoodlers sell later, they lose more.,
Wait, people lose money in RobinHOOD? I thought that was a myth.,
Desperate times call for desperate measures,
50% of the time it works 100% of the time!,
Smart move! Now move to the mobile platform and you’ll be rich!,
Idk why everyone hates RobinHood so much,
Does that mean I can destroy the circuit breaker in my house and wipe away my debt?,
Robinhood trader severs testicles after realizing they don't have the balls to switch to a real broker,

Hey /u/toolbox_financial, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.,
have you seen their stock prices already?  
this feels kinda late.,
just read China Tesla Y uses AMD Ryzen. 

ugh, wish i bought AMD NVDA last year.,
They have a new CEO that laid off a lot of their more experienced employees while they were trying to ramp their fab. Rumor at the time is he wants to go fabless, but good luck getting more cap from foundry right now, if they do it will be at a premium which will lower profit margins.

$MCHP is in the same space but has higher profit margins, has long term expansion plans for their US fabs, and recently announced an expanded stock buy back program.,
I sat on the sidelines and watched this go from 42 to 62 in just a few months. Jumped in at 58. Leaps and shares. I think it will keep going. This is the first dd I’ve seen on here about ON. Thanks buddy,
Qualcomm,
Buying puts on ON this dd is shit and ON is overbought.,
Look at my history I've been saying buy ON for 2 years lol. Its kinda late imo. Still some baby gains to be made but I have sold.,
WOLF Wolfspeed (formerly CREE) also does semis for cars,
Ill just buy the semiconductor etf 3x lvrg (SOXL), instead of trying to pick one company individually.,

I mean dont indexes hold these large caps?,
I mean at this point is Apple and Nvidia really a flashy growth company? Aren't they an established firm much like Samsung and Google. Firms like Snow and Teledoc are "flashy growth" imo.,
Fuck wsj is so goddamn retarded. Why listen to stupid journalists when no economist in the right mind would tell you to sell your stocks in this environment? Even if we crash 30% down the line I‘ll take that over a -6% return p.a on my bank account or bonds. Fuck this. Spy all the way to 940 by 2024. you heard it here first.,
Watch AMD hit $250 before end of next year.,
NVDA $400,
There's no more small businesses, everyone knows they'll either get crushed or robbed and sued into oblivion. They're just throwing money at Tesla saying at least this guy has ideas he's trying to make real. Where else can anyone put money these days now that real estate is so expensive and the middle class is disappearing? Our life savings is pocket change. POCKET CHANGE you hear me? We can't spend it on anything worthwhile, the scammers've grown so sophisticated they'd have it all. gibble gobble gibble gobble!,
The funny thing about this is the "pros" lost more selling 😆😆,
Can someone explain so my smooth brain can understand…. Why wouldn’t people buy growth stocks during inflationary periods?  It seems like selling and holding cash is the idiotic thing to do so what do they expect?  Buy bonds?,
Over value? No... No... No... Shut up and pump your dumb money in to these companies,

Theyre in debt. Run. Or you’ll catch financial irresponsibility itis,
We have that too. It's called "facebook.",
exciting times,
This is how Squid recruiters find players,
It's a great thought that soon, my  student debt can be paid off with 16 gallons of gasoline.,
Makes gold digger's job easier.,
Do they have one for governments, bsuiness, and home owners?,
Don’t get near me poors or else the alarm will go off 🚨,
Poors alert,
That really was a good Simpson's episode.,
College campuses would turn your phone into a vibrator, for her pleasure.,
I think there was a Black Mirror episode like that,
The US has that too. It's called their clothes and teeth lol,
Breaking: New strain of COVID…

COVIDBIGDEBT
==================================

VERY CONTAGIOUS…,
Wasn’t this a black mirror episode?,
Society may be crumbling, but at least I am the 1000th upvote,
How to change Identity?? Asking for self,
Why dont they just come join this sub , where ppl brag about debt 💸 📉🤤🤤,
I would sooner have the Chinese social credit score than our credit history policy. Can't pay a bill one month sorry no mortgage for you, same for trying to rent a place sorry you were unemployed for a week in your early 20s too much risk to let out to you. Atleast in China you get points for doing the right thing while our system just hangs over and follows you like a dark cloud no matter what you do to try fix the fucker and to try fix the fucker your playing straight into the capitalist trap of taking out more credit in order to show off you can pay up a credit card. So if your like me and pay your bills with cash and everything else with cash because I don't spend what I don't have also negatively effects the credit history because I don't take out credit and my only non utility contract being my phone isn't really enough to influence the credit score up the way lol. Our system is set up to get you in as much debt as possible without defaulting and if you do default your fucked for years and years. And for young people starting life it's near impossible to do without getting into debt its fucked.  Atleast the Chinese dosent hide what it is.,
Wow just like in America with Credit scores and the way we treat the poor and homeless. It's nice to see multiple countries running toward their own dystopian nightmare before we go extinct as a species.,
They pay debt like hot potato, last person to hold it when it blows up has to pay for all of it,
no losses until you sell,
Shame on them, China I mean.,
I've always wondered how much in debt people here really are. I'd hope most are at least somewhat green, right? Or are people *really* gambling away their life savings and ending up in debt? (Apart from the idiots yoloing their student loans and going 4k in debt or some shit),
ROTFLMAO,
How do people read titles like that and not realize its most likely just western propaganda,
How would it read the US debt would the fed just explode,
so they will just crowd around every american visitor to China so they can say " i collected one!!",
all you smooth brains assuming debt is a bad thing, most billionaires have tons of debt,
invest in foreign currency,
your phone would explode with such an app in the US,
There’s a lot of people in this country (US) that are looking at what the ChiComs are doing and like what they see,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
[Pretty much this](https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM),
Debtdar,
Money is created through debt... Hmm...,
I have nearly three million dollars in debt. All of it at a low fixed rate.,
A solution to this inflation issue is straightforward and easy.

The only thing the government needs to do is to collect the taxes that are already on the books. No new taxes, just collect those that are on the books already.

Less money needs to be printed, the budget doesn’t have to be a problem.

Also, we could stop subsidising the oil industry, giving yet-more-tax-cuts to the wealthy and cut $250 billion out of the DoD budget and lo and behold things might be turning around.,
Great way to get people to social distance.,
\*USA has exited the chat\*,
\*Apple bans app from Apple store\*,
Doesn't anyone who has a car or house loan be classed as debt? So really the phone app would be going off like crazy,

Sorry to get serious on such a non serious meme,
\*Congress introduces 2 Trillion dollar anti-social anti-credit bill\*

\*Will be signed in 2022\*   

&#x200B;

$SPY: Breaths heavily,
Hot single debts are in your area!,
For some, society is just a computer game. Wish we had an old save file.,
You mean we're going to be lit up like a beacon if we go to Shanghai?,
So, what happens to $TLT?,
Don’t fuckin stand next to me then. You merely talk about YOLO and 💎🙌; I live and breathe YOLO and 💎🙌. And on $WISH no less….

Like I said I would…. Got a homie angry….,
Everyone in America: 😅,
Where can I go to sign up? I hate people and don't want them anywhere near me.,
Well these squid game tactics got aggressive as fuck,
That's funny tho cause basically everyone in china is in debt thanks to the direction their economy has taken over the last 20 years. The govt encouraged everyone to borrow to buy property,
If your debt doesn't start with the IRS threatening to take your financed car, dont talk to me.,
I love this :) All this will China lead to complete destruction 🐻,
Thing with that is they're either normal consumer spending debt or absurdly rich and leveraged to the tits.,
Yeah cause enough people in China aren’t already killing themselves over debt rn 🙄,
If you are in debt but don't download that app, there is nothing they can do right? Asking for a friend in China.,
welcome to the banana Republic of China,
they always find ways to amaze me,
I mean, title as written:

Yes, but if inflation hits that point the odds are likely banks will raise rates to astronomical levels to prevent you paying off your loans.

Can't have *the poors* being debt free after all.,
It was either college or stocks,
bro wtf china is fucking disgusting,
Nice place, China. Nice people.,
Got to get that squid game rolling over there.,
Greetings fellow bag holder,
Xi Jinping’s phone will explode next time he visits the US and gets anywhere near the Fed bulding,
Published on Jan 22, 2019, this article pointed out that only one province in china implemented the app, while making it sound like the entire country uses the app… 1 out of 23 provinces

Any update for the app in 2021? I find it odd that western media stopped reporting after 2019. /s

And yes, I fully expect people to accept the propaganda to confirm their political bias, since most if not all western audience doesn’t know what social credit really is. Heck, we have credit scores in the us already.,
Fuck yeah china,
Everyone has a debt in some way. Auto loans. Housing mortgages, student debt. So that app is stupid.,
Ethics aside... Isn't this a bad idea, socially speaking? It makes people having a rough time (something that can happen to anyone) unable to recover by themselves and damages the familiar/friendship ties.

...Unless that's the entire point, and they are doing this so that people can only rely on the state when they need help (generating a dependency that those in power can abuse).,
If they can print money why make people pay taxes to begin with? Why not just print it 🤔

Oh, because it wastes what little freetime we have available even more than all the other bullshit we gotta deal with.,
An app to keep elitists away frome me?? America needs this...,
Will also help identify most criminals.,
Welcome to the squid games prequel.,
So should I pile on debt or not?,
Who cares, fuck China.,
Anyone know how to turn this off? My phone keeps bleating with notifications while I'm getting sucked off behind Wendys,
China over there actively trying to make a black mirror episode reality.,
This is how Squid Game starts,
Bruh you have to dumb as hell to fall for this lmao,
if she is sexy you will know JUST what to say. "Hey baby, i hear you owe 5k. Wanna fk?",
kind of love it.

Sheng-Ji Yang would be proud.,
good keep 6 feet away from my student loans,
GLD, SLV. Currencies are worth less,
Just one step closer to squid game this gives the train station man his targets to play ddakji with, slap, then give his card to...,
If I owe Robinhood $100 that's my problem.

If I owe Robinhood $5 million that's Robinhood's problem.,

The completely verticle arrow on your last chart is all the DD I needed.,
I got a ban bet on BB...100% see it running.

Ban bet is $15 by December 15.  But, a few apes and this will hit blue skies and moon.,
How many times am I going to fall for this...... I suppose one more couldn't hurt.,
Fine...... I'll buy more BB,

Everybody needs to see this! Let's get this info out to all fellow bb apes! Godspeed brothers and happy Thanksgiving!,
BB has kept tickling my balls - I’ll continue to let it tease me,
BB loves to let me down..I have high hopes tho, appreciate the post !,
If valuation was remotely near competitors in cyber security alone this would be at $90,
Don BB! This is the DD right here, Blackberry is Backberry. Let’s beast.,

You had me at 🚀🚀🚀,
Is the time ripe for blackberry? 🚀🚀🚀,
Black Berry is the tartest of all positions!,
Let’s go bb to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀,
BB was the first stock I ever bought a long time ago. I guess I'm going back to the beginning and it feels good. Count me in you clever summbitch!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
I really hope so. I got some $12 calls expiring in Jan and it's been under water for a long long time...,
The dip is tRanSItOrY let’s gooo!,
I'm all in 🚀🌕,
My BB bags are heavy but still have them packed and ready for the ride,
I didn't read any of it but there were a lot of pictures so I'm going to go all in,

Someone… buy!,
What's their PE?,
Oh boy, here I go buying again. Kept my shares but can add more and some options.,
I didn't understand any of this. 

I'm in.,
Ill fall for this again why not,
Jan 15 2023 $15 calls only $2!!!!,
BB has printed money for me 3 times this year.,
No doubt about it, I am ready to be hurt again.,
Friday we march,

311 shares since Jan @ $13 - Please take off as soon as possible![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735),
Bb-ready for takeoff ☄️,
I’m in for 900,
One last time… 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
All in all, bb to the moon?,
1200 shares @12 reporting for duty sir,
Not doing this again








#im in,
I'm bullish on BB long-term but what is your reasoning to see $30 by early 2022? Is it mainly the patent resolution? I don't see any real major catalyst that would spark it to $30 that fast unless I am missing something? Short squeeze?,
BB spends so much time at $10 you'd think its a SPAC,
1000 upvotes in 9 hours.  BB gets buyers in this quantity Friday it is going to move up.,
Great Post.  Just got myself another 200 shares 😀
To the moon 🌙 🌚 ✨,
I'm Canadian so why not lol. Paycheuqe came today anyways.,
The red arrow straight up tho 🍆,
I’m in at $12.38 :/,
Isn't every meme stock forming a nice triangle?,
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Buy Buy BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
HFS I’m in.,
UKbro here. 
Heavily leveraged on spread betting (20 pounds per point).

If we dip below 10 again I've lost it all but should this baby bounce, I can finally join the club!,
I really feel like bb might take years to get rid of the meme stock status that scares investors. Which is a real shame. Isn't profits pretty low as well? Just need to see MORE.. MORE!!!! (Kylo ren) from them. 

The future is bright, but only till Wallstreet says so:/,
It will go with the Amazon car tech as with Jeff’s compensator rocket.,
I'm still holding my 2 shares. To the moon!,
Bagholder reports - 14.4 average. Let’s fucking go,
Get the fuck out and take my upvote,
hi, I see you are german, what trading app are you using?,
Only 3000 in shares at $9.7. Have made a couple of thousands selling weekly calls. Best stock for me for passive income.,
Been in this a while now. Buy rumour sell news baby go $bb !!!!,
Had like 30 shares that I been taking heavy losses on for sometime it’s about time I seen a quality shit post about blackberry that’s gonna make me buy more stock, good looks man,
Started with 500 shares since 2013 that I purchased at \~$14/share, and I pretty much forgot about it.  Just in the last couple of years, I started accumulating (especially after the AWS/IVY news)....now at 21,000sh @ \~$10 average (would have been way lower if I didn't FOMO during the Jan meme run for 5000 shares around $17/sh.)  Pretty much all of my portfolio.,
Got some shares and 17$ C exp 2024. Fly baby fly i need that bb squirt juice all over my tendy wendy plate,
Urgh screw you, here we go again, we're in boys.,
Also the MAC-D for 1 and 2 hour charts crossed and 4 hour and daily about to cross,
Vertical arrow on chart… Im buying more,
I was gonna buy until I saw the last image.,
New to this stocks thing, how many shares should I buy in order for me to make some really good money?,
#BB,
what are  your expectations for earnings at the end of december?,
Holding my 1100 shares confidently at 13 USD bullish af LFG,
Dec 23rd $15 calls let's go 💪🦍🦍,
You convinced me.

I put my whole portfolio into $10 and $12.50 Jan 21 calls,
Fuck , I just unloaded my position.,
I have BB but it's made me pessimistic. Everytime there is good news, the stock goes down. They probably will announce a $1 billion deal and the stock will tank to $5,
I’m just waiting for institutions to sell whilst saying “it’s all been priced in since like January, idiots!”.,
I swear bb gets a pump post every month and then 10% drop,
Going full moon mode with BB fuel,
This aged well. Down 5% pre market,
I sold BB at a loss. Not falling for this again. I’d still be at a loss if I held it right now.,
Lots of words for a dead stock. That last image gave me a huge laugh, ty,
>Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO

\> Lisa Su appointed CEO in 2014 -> $AMD **runs up almost every year** **for 7 years**

\> AMD revenues steadily climb after 2016 low

&#x200B;

\> John Chen appointed CEO in 2013 -> $BB **trades sideways** **for 8 years**

\> BB revenues fall almost every year since 2013

&#x200B;

[Seems legit](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/stock-comparison?s=revenue&axis=single&comp=AMD:BB).,
The big BANG = BlackBerry, AMC, Nokia, GME!,
>John J Giamatteo from McAfee
As a programmer - this is not a positive. I like Blackberry, but McAfee should really count as malware, it's one of the worst programs ever designed.

That being said, bb to the moon, 🚀🚀🚀etc,
You know who else has a lot of patents? 

Ibm,
Betting 1 of 2 nuts on a Monday move.,
Only people making money on $BB are the people that work there.,
Oh, thank you for the suggestion, bought 10C Exp:18-Feb-22 calls at 1.50, total return as of today -38%. Now I feel like a real ape <3,
Bagholders lolol,
Honest Q, if you think this stock is gonna 🚀, how do you account for all the insider selling in 2021? What do you know that the insiders don't?

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bb/insider-activity 

Edit: Sauce.,
bbagholders,
I smell a bag holder,
Good news? Dip,
Again lol?,
I like this at $7-$8 or will be interesting to see if it bounces of that $9.50 support. I could see BB as ripe for an acquisition, assuming it can continue to penetrate IOT and cyber security and reduce its operating expense by a shit ton, likely would need major downsizing in order to do so as they have like 3500 employees. Looking, I would say kinda,undervalued at $6B when compared to its competitors.

EDIT 1: This company has cash flow issues and needs to downsize in all likeliness in order to reduce its operating expense. All of its revenue is getting raped by its operating expense and it’s revenue is not exactly pouring in either. It’s also disturbing that it won’t have enough cash to cover its short term liabilities for next quarter. I would almost expect them to issue shares to try and raise some capital for its current liabilities this would drop share price however. 

EDIT 2: Earnings don’t look much better. Projected average 177M revenue, which if hit, will be raped by -87% net profit margin sooooo not gonna help much with cash. 

EDIT 3: Yes, I know, COVID has crushed hopes and pillaged cash from companies,honestly shoved BB made it. 

Long term Chen is going to need to stop the bleeding before he can really be aggressive in the software transition strategy…..which is a wise move. Good news is he recently was granted 3M incentive based RSUs so he is def motivated to perform and likely directly motivated to raise SE and the stock price. Who knows, I have seen crazier things happen when the apes band together. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️,
The reason why I’m concerned about BB in the long term is due to the long term debt that they have compared to their equity. There has also been a low free flow to market capitalization. I’m definitely interested to see where it goes in the long term. I’m eyeing 2024 12 calls as well as 500 shares of equity. Thanks for the great write up,
Where’s that bot that spots bag holders lol,
It's year 2025. BB is 12 bucks and you guys will be like "iTs MoOniNg"

Former BB shareholder/employee who bought at 8 and sold at the meme run up,
BB is gonna moon! We’re chatting about what moves to take here https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSqueezeCentral/,
So we should buy puts, got it,
BB is the next WISH,
From your profile, and the way you write posts, I really think you work for hedge fund. You should disclose that.,
You comparing BB, which has completely stagnant growth, to CRWD, which has parabolic growth? Man, you are special.,
You have great intentions and a good analysis, but i don't think $BB is really going anywhere on the short / medium term.

On your own slides, **the next projection they have is FOR FUCKING 2030** my guy. That's another 8 year development cycle. It's way too long for this stock to skyrocket for now. Their business partner's are currently irrelevant unless they can crack that $TSLA partnership that they've been cooking for a while, but everyone knows Elon thinks BB is just an old company that doesn't fit their current moat.

Also, hedge funds are not directly increasing their positions on $BB, they increased 50% quantity to add 20% value... That means they are doing an "average down price" kinda play, to dump it on top of retail. Also, a 25mm position is pretty much nothing. If a few of us guys together here could buy more then the whole position that Morgan Stanley holds, this means Morgan Stanley doesn't hold anything significant in it.

This stock has nothing to do with AMD man, AMD makes HARDWARE, and you yourself said that $BB is transitioning away from hardware to software-based solutions. They are not comparable companies or comparable positions at all, totally different companies in totally different situations really. You could perhaps say they looked like GME and it would be a more fair comparison, but, still, it's such a different outlook. GME NEVER had golden days and lost all value, it was a average company that went bad... $BB has had it's golden days and lost a ton of value by bad decisions of company management. They had golden days and burned a lot of bridges down. It's different. Don't do it. At least, not for another 6 years. It's way too long of a bet to enter it now.,

I remember downloading a 1.4Mb QNX rile and booting up a PC using this RTOS. I was completely blown away. I guess bb somehow acquired it? 

Anyway, QNX on the desktop was super cool. As for cars, I saw this

Pizza Time!,
Dollar store now $1.25 store. What are the chances they go back to a buck?,
I don't think you know what the word transitory means.  The fed uses a little different dictionary then us common folk,
Well

The thing is the price goes in rythme with salary!

But But But

Where is the rising part of my paycheck???,
If you want to have fun Google “margin expansion” and “earnings transcript” restrict to last month. 

Almost every single company is jacking up prices right now because they can. 

Folks have lots of money to spend and this cat ain’t going back in the bag. 

It’s not supply constraints and fuel (that’s a little bit of the price increase, but if it was everything…we wouldn’t be seeing “margin expansion”, if anything we’d see margins shrinking), it’s just corporate greed and shoppers who are suckers enough to keep buying overpriced shit.

Where all the consumer cash is coming from, I have no idea. But folks are spending like crazy.,
Inflation is not transitory... "yet"...

\- JPOW 2029,
To be fair, the ice age was also transitory.,
Anyone ever thought of the idea of instead of adding .25 cents to the loaf of bread, just take away three slices? Then after an adjustment period, return the 3 slices and charge only .10 cents more.,
Fear Bait in this one is strong...,
Im a little worried. I started posting comparisons of the stock market to the M2 supply showing that weve actualy been in a sideways market for 10+ years compared to purchasing power. .... now my trading view wont register any derivative graphs with money supply... pretty sure im on a watchlist lol,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Anyone with a 🧠 knew this in the spring 🤷‍♂️,
Actual facts on WSB? What is happening right now?,
Why even bother to say anything at all? They can raise or lower or do anything they want, it’s not a democracy it’s a dictatorship, he doesn’t have to convince anyone of his decisions.,
When the Truth is obvious but politicians pretends we are stupid or something. Yeah ok.,
Without inflation stocks wouldn't go up. Stonks are good, henceforth inflation is good.,
Next months inflation numbers could be over 7%,
I’ve got the [powell !](https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM),
This too shall come to pass.,
Loololllplolollloll,
Buy silver and gold as a hedge against inflation.,
...and nothing to do with printing $5 trillion of the $9 trillion in circulation in the last 24 months or adding $6 trillion to the US debt of $23 trillion in 2020...,
So you all expect inflation to stay at 6%+ for many years or what? I doubt it.

If it falls within a year or two to below 6% then it has indeed been transitory.,
Morons thinking this pent up demand inflation is permanent probably thoughts oil would be negative dollars forever too.,
Is the printer broke?,
The authorities changed the definition of "vaccine".  The authorities changed the definition of "fully vaccinated".  The authorities changed the definition of "emergency".  The authorities changed the definition of "crime". 

You don't think they changed the definition of "transitory" and just failed to publish it?  1984,
Whats this? you mean the government constantly lies to us? - who would have known,
Lmao. Please accept this award.

But, seriously though, I genuinely believe inflation was caused by covid-19 lockdowns and not loose monetary policy. 

Give the man a break….,
Great one thanks,
FUCCCCKKKK,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Collect your fucking taxes, you fucking morons!,
If somebody told you I was your average ordinary Chairman of the Fed- somebody lied.,
Everyone is happily willing to pay inflated prices for the same goods. They even have a motivation to buy more as they believe it will be even more expensive in the future.

Inflation is bullish on stocks,
Did they actually finally admit that?,
Yeah it is tho? Straight to communism or faschism.,
But we do appreciate everything you do. Here’s a fun sign we’re gonna put outside your workplace for everybody to vandalize. Later ho’s,
The jig is up, the news is out they've finally found me,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Disturbing on so many levels... Bravo,
Inflation has been so low it's been even deflation at times. Back in the day there was a lot of inflation. So things change,
We know Jerome, no one believed it was transitory,
Is she telling him or is he telling her? 😉,
Cue up someone with an economics degree telling me printing more money will curb inflation.,
Once gas goes up it takes a long time to go down and we won't see under 3 for years.,
I'm convinced it will be 

We still believe inflation is transitory but will be raising rates anyway lmao,
It is transitory, but difficult to achieve long term.  The money cycle goes like this.  Government lower interest rates to increase borrowing.  To do this they need to print money, lots of money.  Once everyone is up to the eyeballs in cheap debt the government contracts the economy by raising interest rates and destroying money (removing it out of the game). They keep this up, ramping up interest, watching the housing market collapse, watching people go to prison for their debts, tens of thousands losing their homes and their jobs.

You might think this is bad, but if you've got money to save it's fantastic.  Oh and those homes where People default on their mortgages amount to a tiny percentage of homeowners, most people will put their wives and mother's into prostitution rather than miss their payments and the banks make a fortune.

They can't push this too much though, because if they do, everything can collapse easily.  So, they time it just right.  Just when most people start thinking of necking themselves they'll start reducing interest, go back to printing money and the cycle begins once more.,
It is transitory. And it’s also not transitory. 

The question is which is more influential, the transitory case is pretty strong, and evidenced outside of US dollar too.,
Bet Powell makes out upside down like a boss,

Money is always the motive,
Because I’m king Midas in reverse, everything I touch turns to shit,
They just make money off the spread

Spread me daddy,
When they buy your ask they are against you. When they sell to your bid they hate you.,
I've noticed if you have options you KNOW that are gonna print, the stock will move in the opposite way at open, just enough time to make you doubt yourself and close some or all out, and then the stock will move hard and fast in the way you expected.    So the lesson is, don't let whatever it is driving that shake you out.  

I always assumed that was hedge funds driving that, but if an options market maker is on the hook for the wrong direction they might also be behind that,
It's the scene in rounders where they go to the casino. You're the tourist that shows up.,
I provide a very specific service. You pay me, I buy stock, stock drops, you buy low, I sell, stock goes up.,
[deleted],
It’s because you only have 33% chance to profit when buying options. 

MM are delta neutral, they don’t care which direction the stock will move, and they don’t care about you,
my mom can fk off screw you for judging me!,
if u had that much money ud be doing the same thing,

lol the amount of $WISH losses I’ve seen is crazy. What’s with the hype around them? My condolences as well.

Edit: I was wondering why my karma was going up so much.,
But it’s green, that’s good, right?,
How do people just lose this much money,
If there was a premium for bad ideas I'd want drilling rights to your head.,
So I buy hella things on wish. Little things nothing major during 2020 I bought a lot of fishing lures and some cool accessories for my car. Spent about 1k on wish in 2020. Fast forward to 2021 around august and for absolutely no reason every purchase I had ever made on wish was fully refunded. I wasn’t the only one this happened to. My gf and a couple of my friends that buy things from wish all got all their orders refunded for no reason. So I’m sure most if not all users were refunded for everything they’ve bought on wish  I’m not sure what caused that but I’m sure they lost millions if not billions due that fiasco.,
God damn a lot of retards in here got absolutely ass blasted by wish.,
Next time just give it to me, I’ll give you half the losses,
Worst of all I actually got banned from buying things on wish after this incident:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Wishstock/comments/q019dg/initialized\_110\_chargeback\_on\_an\_wish\_order\_and\_i/,
It's always wish in these screen shots,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This is a loss that won't be a good long hold.,
Of all the companies to choose from and you chose this dog.,
Seriously, why do so many people YOLO on $WISH. The memes says everything you need to know about this stonk LOL,
Ayoooo bro this gotta suck,
Congratulations!  

I think?,
I don't get how selling counterfeits is not a red flag and you stayed invested in this company.,
Keep going and you’ll have a diversified portfolio,
I thought you were showing my @CLOV position, but then I saw you have only lost 54.81% and I realized it wasn’t mine.  

Nice try but you’ll have to lose more to catch me.,
When you yolo thinking it can't go any lower. I did this with uwmc when I thought $9 was low.,
I want this go for $69 not $0.69🤦‍♂️,
Congratulations on your bereavement,
Sleeping in the tool shed rights unlocked! 😂,
Can you just cash out $10k and zelle me the money before your account goes to zero? It’ll go to paying off some bills thank you.,
S e l l c a l l s,
Please run away if you wish.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
You still have five figures. You only lost one figure.,
dude, did you ever order from wish?

I ordered a watch and it turned out to be a cheap toy.

i ordered wind chimes and they sent me some weird sex toy.

dude come on man. are you serious with spending 100 k on WISH stock???,
I can't believe so many fell for this Chinese scam company....ridiculous,
What took you so long? Congratulations &Welcome to the club,
Task failed successfully,
I remember making money on those puts thank you,
Its insane how much people can lose on SHARES.  
like what the hell, might as well just blow this off on options.,
Buy the dip pussy,
I made $16 off the one wish call I played this year. Feels good.,
Why the fuck aren’t people setting trailing stop losses? It’s not cool or funny to lose this much on shares alone.,
Lmao fuck. Hopefully you get to zero. Best of luck !,
Anotha one..,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
With this kind of money playing this kind of stock, you have WISH,
It doesn’t look like you sold. So it’s not actually a loss.,
The final accomplishment.,
Get this man a shield!,
Amex knew you had money in stocks and options. They decided to sell all of their shares and short the fuck out of wish for the sole reason just to fuck you after their financial review,
There should be flairs that you can only get after proving something like this to a mod. 6Figures in red or green.,
good job op.atleast you didnt fomo in at > $20,
How many of you retards bought this shit stock? No one uses Wish, first red flag,
Was that your $wish?,
I *$WISH* you best of luck king,
Guh,
Everyday I Wish I bought puts😞😞 WHY DO YOU NEED ME TO LOGIN Before I check out ur site 🙁🙁,
I see the color green good job man,
*achievement unlocked* crayon eating retard! Somebody get this man a helmet!,
Because you didn’t go 100% retard,
Seeing all this loss porn makes me want to buy WISH just for the memes,
I can only get to 5, any way to go to six-figures like this guy?,
Good job retard! See ya in the food stamp line!  fr though, that sucks.. you should mail your phone to mexico and lock your doors,
lol i remember when everyone was hyping up wish on here.  I took one look at their website, and was like yeah this company is fucking trash.  I can’t believe anyone would be bullish on them 😂,
Sell CC’s until you break even?,
This man lost this much on shares I cannot,
How people get this much money to lose it, I'm sad that I'm 1k down in wish but holy fuck,
Everyone in this reddit dropping 10K+ on stocks meanwhile Im just trying to make my 150 bucks count,
Nice tax deductible,
But they said buy shares instead of options they said,
They say membership requires 250k loss so you're like halfway there good job!,
Average down for 7 figure possibility,
You're a fucking moron. Look how much you owe... was it worth it? Listening to a bunch of fucking retarded twats. Hope you've got money to pay some of this off you dickhead.,
Yay I was here long before you nerd,
We $WISH you a Merry Christmas!,
Wish took a dive because the French government is cracking down on them for selling  counterfeit and unsafe goods from China.
They asked search engines to de-list and block Wish.,
Think positive, you own shares not options. You will be fine some day... good luck,
this stock makes SDC look like a rockstar in comparison,
Do you sell covered calls. You could make reduce your cost basis significantly while you wait for this to rebound, which it will.,
at 3.97 doe, how low can it go, might have to yolo moms life savings on hopes this guy breaks a profit,
I mean tbh it has serious potential. Buying now and it being so cheap is nice. I feel like they’re 2 good choices away from booming. Someone described that they need a few facilities in various countries that hold their most popular items and have them available for fast shipping.,
love how everything’s still green,
achievement unlocked!,
Coal for xmas....,
Nicely done..keep going,
Why the fuck are you still holding? Just sell and you can get into stocks and options that can get you that loss back,
At least they are shares not fds,
I still don’t get why don’t you guys just leave this stock alone,
I’m convinced all the wish positions are bots 
No way a regular person does this,
I could of seen my kids more often with this money...,
Switch to puts?,
u/MagThanos,
I wish the same. 🤦‍♀️,
Don't $WISH this on anyone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Are you still bullish on this?,
This is an even bigger mess than $BABA.,
Balances the gain by wsb ❤️,
Put that shit in AMZN the fuck,
Are you selling 210 CCs to lower cost basis? It’s something,
Congratulations my dude!!,
Excellent.,
This has to be the most retarded stock ever. Don't know why people keep buying it.,
Pretty sure someone somewhere jumped because of the wish pump,
all this wish loss porn…. should have bought amc,
1/3 of the way there,
Im only at a 160$ loss am I doing this right ?,
I'm also bag holding too but holy fuck.

Wish has up potential but also plenty of potential to go to 0 too. Definitely not something you put 6 figures in.,
At least they aren't options...,
[removed],
Nice,
Greeeeen,
Wow,
Achievement unlocked,
Shit like this makes me so happy I never touched wish. Good luck op,
same here, mine didn't start with digit 1,
Why did you unjustly l initially buy into wish and why do you still hold it?,
Proud 🦆,
How people get this much money to lose it,
How people get this much money to lose it, I'm sad that I'm 1k down in wish but holy fuck,
just buy more to average down..,
I don't understand. Green graph, why negative? Wutdo?,
How?,
Hope you thank Zack!,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Why you guys buying wish I am new here I don't get it,
Is this one of those stocks you buy just to sell shitty covered calls on to people who actually thinks it's worth something,
Yuch..
What stock?,
Striving for new goals everyday,
all in near term options on the rest - kill it or be killed. either way, life's fake anyway.,
All you had to do was buy puts with the other 50.18% and you would have made money,
Off,
Something like go big or go home,
00f,
My dad once ordered something on Wish, and got a pair of jeans and a jacket that looked like both were made for only $1 sent for no reason, and his balance was negative. I just closed his account for him and told him to never touch Wish again. There are retards out here but how retarded do you have to be to buy into wish lol.,
[removed],
Was Wish a meme stock ?,
Remember when we were told WISH was a legit competitor to Amazon….,
Congrats and fuck you!  


Oh wait...,
what's the twitter guys name that shilled this then dipped calling anyone who sold retarded?,
Makes me feel better about my 6k loss.,
Solution - sell just NFTs only. No recalls, no bad feedbacks. WISH should actually sell wishes (poof). That’s my pitch for the CEO position!,
Level 2 unlocked,
I think I’ll start a long position soon. Thanks,
So what you are saying is the rest of us should buy wish cause it’s so low??,
At least it's all green,
that dip looks tasty - may be the time to average down! Think about it! It can only go down $4 more dollars...but it can go UP forever!,
Damn,
Praying for the Zack Morris victims,
Wheres the short sale gains for wish?,
Life goals,
I $WISH you a happy thanksgiving,
Bro it’s a knockoff site…. You’re own fault,
This is what happens when you watch Dragon Tales.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
bet u( wish) u didn't do that,
I “wish” you the best,
Hmm. When WISH market cap falls below $1.5B, then the little bot dude who looks like a character from He-Man will filter it out of WSB… like trading in the pink sheets… and NASDAQ requires >$4 price for 90 days. Maybe $1 February puts will help you get your money back. NFA,
21k shares is still $2k a month in CC premium until it gets delisted.,
🐐,
Stop I can only get so hard,
How did this happen??,
Is it time to buy $WISH!? Can’t go lower right guys!?,
Good work,
Sorry bro, I lost over 100K this year as well. Still haven’t posted yet.,
Congrats man! 🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦🚀🚀🚀,
Just curious how much WISH retail own at this pace.,
Just like anything you order off the site, you just have to wait three months for it to deliver,
Wish might be a decent investment at these levels,
Donation to make a wish foundation. How nice,
You did it!,
Just hold Brew!,
I don’t even feel bad I remember the day everyone was buying wish it was the dumbest thing ever,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260),
Lol it's like everyone is a guy on here, you here the buy but choose not to here the part in the dd where it says its a quick play and forget to hit sell button when the time comes, but great fucking work retard good luck to ya thanks for the loss porn,
Yeah, but when are you gonna buy back in.,
The worst thing is that it has way more to go down... Take what you can bro - WISH is a dog.,
If you are still holding this, it is about to get way worse.,
wow. $wish,
Let’s make a real 6 figures the slow way https://youtu.be/O4jG4pIUMj0,
I remember for about a week all you saw were “I made a WISH” posts.,
you retards are STILL buying WISH? 

&#x200B;

I've been seeing WISH losses for months now. Maybe its time to learn something from your fellow WSBer,
SELL COVERED CALLS,
I am so glad I sold mine at $15 ....... only to put in $meli,
Six figure. Nobody counts pennies, you chump.,
Get the fuckk outta here with the Robbinhood  fake graph,
Oh no Daddy-O, you bought WISH!,
You just love giving money to the CCP don’t you,
Fuck,
They will come back. I'm buy crayons from them and then their stock.,

I remember when everyone would freak out when we made it on the news or mentioned in an article. Now the news reports on wall street bets like we’re a fortune 100 company,
Wow. Great job OP! You made the WISH bagholders cry.,
And to add to that if you buy shit or options on shit and it pops briefly take your profit.  And then leave some in the shit if you want.  when $CLOV popped I made 5000% on my calls in hours and sold them.  I lost $100 on wish calls.  $100 on SDC calls.  $200 on 0DTE FB calls because I got greedy and didn’t sell at 100% up.,
Eventually everything dies, once the sub saw the mainstream, it was over.,
There’s gonna be plenty from this era once the free Fed money is gone.

Ive been around long enough to trade in 2000 when i was in college just after the tech bubble was starting to burst.  Some of my first picks were Ericsson, Worldcom, and Global Crossing. 📉📉📉 Either BK’d or worthless.,
Paysafe has entered the chat room....,
Wish,
…*cough*…SDC…*cough*…,
Don't tell me how to lose MY money, Dad,
Counterpoint: in this last year, the less I know about the underlying, the better my trades do.  This is a market that rewards a momentum investor, not a fundamentalist.,
I'm looking at you PSFE dip,
Don't believe him guys, buy the dip, average down, it's going to the moon for sure!

They call you bagholder I call you future board member,
Buy WISH?,
WISH Bagholders: The dog fleshlight and crack pipe industries are the future of America!,
Who actually thought Wish was gonna be anything? Wish took off and died immediately when I was a teenager. And the only people actually using it were poor parents like mine.,
You heard the man.. buy $WISH!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
The thing is with GME play as retarded as it seemed back then, people were not throwing life saving into it. People through from few hundred to few thousands at best or the money they could lose and be ok with it.

However we know what happened to GME and people now regret not throwing everything into GME so therefore are looking for next GME and because they are afraid to miss it they throw everything into it which is beyond retarded even by WSB standards.,
It would be fine to invest in whatever you want, but just don't put your life savings in actual stinkers. now 10 percent? go ahead and fuck around,
Pretty sure this was the argument against DFV when he waltzed in with GME dd...,
Whenever I heard people putting their life-saving on wish... you know.... WISH ... even if it was 1 cent a share I would never buy anything as trash as motherfucking WISH.,
This ain’t r/stocks buddy. Retards only. I’ll buy whatever dip I want,
But my wife’s boyfriend said to(?),
GPS: 6.6B Cap—3B Cash—16.6B revenue 

OPAD: 1.7B Cap with 1.9B Revenue 

LEV: 2B Cap with 1B backlog active orders,
You Wish bro. Here for a good time not a long time.,
So, PTON calls then. Got it.,
r/dwac,
MVIS,
Thank you for the post. I own bright health group shares. From $8.60 it’s gone down to $4 . A bit worried now.,
Hertz is not impressed. (Don't ask what HTZ is doing these days or why it added a Z to its name.),
A wise man always told me Lose your opinion before you lose your money,
Wtf ban. You are looking for r/investing. Get out of here. This is where $wishes come true.,
Didn't people make bank for Hertz?,
You're talking about rivian aren't you. :(,
Looking at you, wish,
WISH is going bankrupt,
WISH will get delisted...

FIFY,
There once was a company called Noranda.,
Don’t try to be rational in this market!,
Well said,
Meh, EGRNY. All in once it drops below $6.50.,
Everyone Buy DSCR cause this guy knows nothing…,
Forbes literally rights my shitpost now 🤣,
No, I don't think i will. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
*inverse....*

It's time to buy stupid worthless companies !,
If people wise up then I won’t get to see some good ole loss porn,
Well for those of us that are solvent we say, not for long!,
I bought 2k worth of options at 22.5 for pluralsight..lmao...you know what,  it went private at 22.5, I got nothing,  and I am still paying for the subscription 🙃 😅,
I don’t take financial advice from retards,
But the tax write offs bro,
You don't sound tarded enuff to be here...,
I am confused "buying companies" what kind of voodoo is that? I thought I was making short term bets on shit going up or down. This week I turned pimp and started making money on things going down. Next week could be things going up. Limit your loss to the bet you make. This is just a casino.,
Calm down uncle,
"buy absolute shit companies" - ok I got it,
[removed],
One of my first stock I bought was Enron.  I was  thinking, they’ll recover from this.

They didn’t,
Glad to see my newest ticker not mentioned here.
I bought DM based on a friend's advice but I have to admit I did zero DD myself. Can I confidently ignore DM for 2-3 quarters?,
Bagheld a dying weedstock for years and now its delisted. I dont like these hard truths,
A little research never hurts that's 4sure.,
How many clown tickets are we talking about? It is hard to keep track of them all these days.,
You must’ve missed the part where the fed printed trillions and handed it to these shitty companies,
Lmao wish.com,
*Cries in SDC bagholder*,
Corsair,
Shit post get out of here… 

Anyone here the latest news about GME?,
As if WSB was ever of quality. Come on this whole thing here is a damn joke. Please dont pretend that it ever meant something important or purposeful. Its simply a joke, enjoy it,
More like since February everything here has been crap. I've just been selling weekly calls out the wazoo to all the new fish that showed up after GME popped,
Bankruptcy bullish. Look at hertz,
The final nail in the coffin for this place was march 2020.,
Last month or two?,
TMC still hasn't been delisted? Where are the bagholders for that?,
Still can't believe people look at WISH ADs and then buy into that POS.,
Iron condor tanking :(,
Like a true retard, I got into WISH and afterwards went to the website. I was amazed at the crappy website and what it had to offer....sold immediately after. Same for SKLZ, I got into it when it was being pumped on WSB, then did the DD, I liked their concept but when I saw the crappy games they had to offer I immediately dumped it for a couple of thousands in profit.,
The thing that drives me nuts is the constant spamming of what companies are shorted and which are being ‘manipulated’

I blame you crayon eaters for making everybody with a robinhood account think that short squeezes happen 3x a week,
>Just because it is a dip or a new low doesn't mean it is good to buy absolute shit companies.

I thought that was the point of this sub. To... YOLO.

I guess times have changed.,
>Wise up.

I initially read this as Wish up.

Calls it is.,
Eventually all sources of revenue dry up.

You must adapt and innovate just to survive, never mind outperform.,
GameStop and AMC want to speak with you,
[removed],
They can *wish* all they want, but it won't make em rich.,
Three common sense rules a lot of people seem to be lacking:

-A massive dip/low is *not* necessarily a sign you should buy (as OP mentioned)

-Massive short interest is *not* good and certainly doesn't mean you're going to become rich by buying into some magical squeeze

-If it's already run up 10,000% in the last two minutes you DO NOT WANT TO BUY,
The wish bag holders are already dead man,
Tesla wasn’t making money and was on huge debts when it started. Those who had foresight in the company are now millionaires. 

GME was on the brink of bankruptcy. So is AMC. 

In my humble opinion, that’s a very dated thinking you have. Sure, I bet there’s those scammy fly by night companies which our mothers’ warned us about. But there are brilliant entrepreneurs out there who just need time and a little faith from their investors. 

AVIS story? Was shorted so bad and hard. But they reported stellar performance. 

Look at Upstart. Didn’t it do well? But holy shxx the share price. 

Grateful to those who made the effort to post their due diligence. Whether shit or not shit companies it’s not your judgement call.,
Go look at a list of how many s&p companies have been delisted. This is why you buy the etf instead of making up your own basket of stocks. Imagine being the guy who went heavy weight on Enron...,
HTZ would like a word...,
Get over it,
Let’s say I was going to say F-it and spend my last 2000 dollars on something. What would you choose,
You talking about $WISH $SDC OR $CLOV I can't tell.,
"all the posts are trash here"

*posts another piece of literal garbage*,
Boo hiss,
CLNE cleaned me out a few months ago been a long road to financial recovery but learned a lot and studied up,
EBON TO THE 🌚,
Tesla stock in the background singing “don’t you WISH your stock was high like me”,
Best case? Write off and you get a tax form.

Worst case? They obtain a money judgement against you and garnish wages.

For the amount you owe? Probably charge off to third party collections.,
This is how I quit drugs. I ran up a big bill with all my dealers and then moved and changed my phone number. Problem solved.,
Just tell them you've temporarily suspended transactions. Ask if it sounds familiar.,
You’re the real Robinhood, stealing from the rich and still being poor 😂,
Delete the app and go about your life. Definitely stop trading 😂,
Time to load on $HOOD puts,
Write a one star review on yelp,
Maybe it'll just go away 😄,
Puts on this guys credit score,
Well, either it goes into collections and you have to deal with debt collectors, or debt collectors know to stay far away from a bunch of ramen eating smooth brains and leave it for Robinhood to collect. Either way, probably not good for your credit.,
Just tell them you have restricted the option to deposit money on their platform citing issues with their volatile stock and regulatory requirements.,
Vlad will call his Russian collectors and they will take care of it.

&#x200B;

Make sure you paid your health insurance premiums,
This is great! Your balance is so good, they tell you it's OUTSTANDING!

Well done!,
Just tell them you turned off the deposit button.,
Change your address on the account. If they can’t find you they can’t take your kneecaps,
I owe them about $5000. Dumb fucks shouldn’t have lent me money I’m very irresponsible.,
Probably destroy your credit haha,
Short robinhood until they go under so you don't have a company to pay lololol,
Welp, you had two chances to learn from your mistake and pull out on the green but you belong here.,
1.  Response 1:  You disabled the ‘deposit button’.
2.  Response 2:  RH, go fuck yourself.
3.  Response 3:  Blow me.
4.  Response 4:  Ignore.,
It’s easy, just delete the app and the debt will be gone. No problems.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Who cares, just give them the big bidness treatment, hold out long enough until they go under. Robinhood can’t collect when there is no Robinhood.,
Prob ding your credit report,
Good thing they don't have your social security number or anything.,
They will eventually write it off and you’ll just pay taxes on what you owe. My “friend” did this so I know ….,
They gonna bend u over and brutally assault that ass in due time if those dues aren’t paid brother, good luck,
Letting people play with options turned Robinhood in an online casino / loanshark xD,
Tell them your deposit button was disabled by market makers unexpectedly increasing their liquidity demands. You regret any inconvenience this may cause them, but that you look to better serving them in the future.,
Stop trading; it's not for you. Once you come out of the other side of bankruptcy, just invest in boring ass funds and don't think about it. I generally think financial advisors are a waste of money, but I'd recommend one in your case because you clearly cannot be trusted with your own money. 

The government will use situations like yours as justification for taking options trading away from retail investors just like they did with day trading when the dotcom bubble popped.

Edit: also, get treatment for gambling addiction.,
Just delete the app all your problems go away that’s what my buddy said,
Tell them you have paused transactions. If that doesnt work, delete and disable notifications,
They email me everyday but other then that nothing wonder if they'll ever send it to collections 🤣?,
Pay back a minimum amount every month. Just to delay the inevitable.  35.00?,
Eventually they'll sue you for it

That'll take some time though,
One day you will want to take out a loan, you won't be able to easily. 

I was a Mortgage broker for 8 years. Declines are real. 

Pay your debts.,
You probably used margin, in other words you lost their money trading. I don’t know the repercussions of not paying your debt to them. You probably eventually should though because it’s never good to owe someone…or you can just delete the app.,
Was this related to margin? Have they been adding interest to the amount you owe?,
Update us when you find out,
They’ll file a small claims suit, Settle it with arbitration and if you don’t show up to court, they will get a default judgment. 
Once they have a judgment, they can do 1 of 3 things to collect. They can garnish your paycheck, they can file a bank levy which drains your bank account entirely, and they can put a lien on your home if you own your home.
If you don’t own a home and have not bought, the mortgage company will look to pay off any outstanding judgements by financing it into your home.,
Well you’re a retard for spending more money than what you can afford. Pay back what you owe idiot,
As long as you don’t care about your credit and being able to do adult things in the near future (mortgage, cars, applying for anything that runs a credit check) then you can take the advice of some of the potatoes in the comments and ignore it. 

If you plan to do adult things, probably work with your lawyer to work with RH about options. 

I was never really a fan of people bombing their finances and then just filing for bankruptcy - such a shitty move. 

My partners entire immediate family, save for his youngest sibling, has pulled this move at some point (Dad, Mom, Him, and one of his younger brothers). His just now dropped off his credit reports this last year, think this was back in 2013? he filed. I’ve got him to change his spending habits a bit but the rest of them live paycheck to paycheck in squalor. 

While it’s not impossible to recover from it - the difficulty setting definitely bumps up to Nightmare mode, especially if there is no support system and you keep repeating the same piss poor choices.,
How did you fail? That literally couldn’t have gone tits up 😂 only one man gets a pass on Robinhood and we all know him as Ironmani,
Next time, do your investing through an offshore LLC and max out that margin!,
Collections,
They’ll just keep sending you this message forever,
[deleted],
I have an even better question....  How the hell does one owe Robinhood anything, much less managing to owe them $4k?  I'm seriously wondering how that's even possible to do.,
YOLO into WISH,
you're a fucking dumbass,
Have a moustache? If not, now’s a great time to grow one. Already got one? Now’s a great time to shave it. Also might wanna consider investing in hats and sunglasses,
Just out of curiosity how did you manage to go into the negative?,
How can you go negative???,
Shut you’re eyes. Problem solved. Works for almost everything,
Delete account and create new one 😅,
Pay your debt. Don’t be a loser.,
Let them send it to the collection agency and then negotiate down and pay it off.,
Nah, they down 4K. You up.,
Pay what you owe……man up 😐,
For a debt like this 4k, they probably won't do much. Tbh, most legal avenues for collecting this debt are more expensive than sending it to collections.

Your ARE on the cusp though. So it's possible that you may get sued in small claims with your local magistrate.

However it's possible, even likely, they don't bother and just send it to collections and in 7 years it goes away.,
Too everyone saying pay what you owe, you can't pay money you don't have... All in all I'm actually 50K in debt and only make 40K a year 🙄 so yeah I'd love to pay them I just can't anytime soon lmao,
So you've been Robbing the Robinghood? 🙂,
Tell them you are doing God’s work! Robbing the rich to owe the rich - nah not working!,
Step 1: let the battery deplete on your phone
Step 2: have you tried uninstalling the app
Step 3: (Profit),
They’ll take you in the back room and break your legs,
Cousin Vinny's gonna have a word with you.,
They'll be gone when GME moons,
And I thought I was retarded,
They actually do nothing,
Just do what they did act like it never happened if they take you to court just lie under oath,
Fuck yer credit up?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Yep ! TELL THEM U CAN'T FIND THE TRANSFER BUTTON IN YOUR ACCOUNT ! 🤣💥,
OP PLEASE READ THIS

Ur gay,
They’ll enter it into collections and get a default judgment against you, garnish your wages, and trash your credit for 7 years.,
Something tells me your email will have more details 🤔,
🐻ish,
Just delete the app bro you’ll be fine,
Robbing the hood.,
Tell them you removed the deposit button.,
They are going to send Little John to break your legs.,
Just delete the app, problem solved,
How does one owe an investment platform?,
They’ll probably debit bad debt expense and credit accounts receivable.,
Just delete the app bro, find a new place to lose money. It’s unrealized losses,
They probably won’t let you trade anymore… oh wait they don’t really do that anyway.,
So here me out.

One time I got drunk and bought a $900 of litecoin on robinhood. 

Woke up freaked out. Took money out of the bank.

The never tried hitting my account.

I logged back in for the first part of the GME Saga.

The litecoin went up in value and they let me sell and gave me the profit. 

It’s like the let me buy LTC on margin and then I just paid when I felt like it a year or so later ( after the price went up. ),
Tell them your unavailable due to planned maintenance,
How does one go NEGATIVE? I didn't think it was possible to go negative by investing???,
Has a single person on here said “hey man…looks like you made some bad choices and owe them some money for your mistakes. Take it as a lesson and pay them the $4k”? Because…um…that’s what should be done, here.,
Hey here's an idea....if you owe it...pay it. And if you can't cover the loss then you shouldn't have been fucking around on Robinhood to begin with....smh It's people like you that end up costing the rest of us more money in the long run....smh again,
Down 170% !? 😂,
“I don’t know why my credit is so poor.”,
So you've been on hold with customer service trying to make the payment for 4 months and counting, right?,
Do what my cousin did to me...Next week I promise, for years!,
Just delete the app.. it worked for me.,
Are you rich and have money? If so, nothing, and you won’t owe anything and nothing will happen to you. 

Do you not have money? If not, something, and they’ll spend our tax payer dollars chasing you for what amounts to a rough Dental bill without insurance, and then throw you into a debt cycle you can’t get out of. 

My advice: Be rich.

/s,
#Hodle,
Thats when the "hood" in Robinhood comes out. Watch your back or as they say in some hoods, keep trucha.,
Whatever they do it’s better than couple guys showing up and touching your lovely legs.,
Robinhood owes me like $30,000 from January. How do I get them to pay up?,
It's probably going to hurt your credit if it goes to collections. Plan on using credit any time soon?,
Deleting the app won’t make your debt go away. Pay your debt.,
You seem really really dumb,

How do you make money when it's delisted?,
When talking about DIDI and POS (point of sale) you need to be careful. Because when you are talking about DIDI, POS stands for piece of shit. In summary DIDI is a true POS company,
You're retarded, and not in a good way,
Go home, you work too late 🤣
Market's closed tomorrow and Sunday  you'll have time to reconsider 😝,
The $DIDI listed in the US is for a separate VIE company, not the company itself. If China really wanted to screw US investors, all they have to do is cancel the contract between the VIE and the parent company. You’ll be a bag holder.,
Buy when others are fearful or you know, lose all your money when it gets delisted,
Did you say buy puts?,
Yeah, millions by brokers,
I've never not got fucked by China.  Won't touch anything there any more.,

The 6.84 commission and fees is the final slap in the face🤣👊,
I was sad about losing 5k. Respect to you,
Then today is the day it turns around. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
You're getting Reddit karma though. So that should cheer you up.,
Avoid taxes with this one simple trick the IRS doesn't want you to know about,
That's just the short term gain. If you look a little to the right, you'll see you broke even on the long term.,
You invested in a Chinese counterfeit flea market.,
going to $50 next week thanks to your contribution,
$6.84 Commission and fees.  Damn.  They didn't even comp your room or give you a free pass to the 24-hour buffet.,
It's not a loss until you sell!  Oh... it's a loss now.,
He sold? Pump eeeeeetttttt,
Damn!,
I'm down like 400$ if it makes you feel any better,
Damn I’m so hard right now.,
Holy fuck, this hurts to look at.,
you can recover from a $5k loss. or a $50k loss even, with proper investing and enough time.

but $500k loss??? dunno man. that is life changing level of damage. 

I know I wouldnt be able to forgive myself if i did a stupid yolo with $500k and lost it all. note to others: dont yolo with six figures. yolo with $5k here and there. 

but good luck, man. please speak to a therapist. you will need some mental support and therapy after surviving this nuke bomb,
When you buy a house from wish but get a cardboard box in the mail,
How TF people get this much money to lose in one go? :(,
If you have that much money to throw around, you could have been making $10k+ a week selling CCs on actually good stocks.,
I can only imagine this feels like your finger sticking through the toilet paper in a public bathroom,
I WISH I didn't buy that stock 😕,
He'll be claiming that 3k tax break till he D I E,
And it goes up 20% once you did,
Dude if you had a better broker with less fees, could have saved some money.,
Hope you didn’t already sell 😂,
didn't need to happen,
The loss isn't realized until your wife realizes you lost a half a million and you don't even have shitty WISH lingerie to gift her.,
Dayyum.....Has anyone asked you if you are okay?,
Calls on wish!,
You deserve to lose it after putting 0.5m instead of 520k,
Fuck this stock. I’m in the same boat.,
I am genuinely curious why you dropped this amount of cash on such a terrible company.,
Dam that was my lambo,
This is worthy of my free award.,
Dude you paid a $6 commission.  You probably qualify for free trades.  Switch brokers.,
Paper hands over here,
I think you zigged when you should of zagged.,
Friday wish squeezes to 20 bucks!,
Why would you put half a million into terrible stock like this. You could have just bought some solid company that is massively down, look at Visa or PYPL, they have been massacred recently but they are actual solid companies, not a disaster like Wish.,
Damn easily lost a house or 2 with that one. Ouch!!!,
Think of all the taxes you don’t have to pay.,
He sold. Pamp it,
#Paper handed biatch!,
These wishtards are my favorite, everyone knew this company was dogshit but they all had a dream, what if it isn't? They may lose money and no one legit uses their site but they have billions in cash. If Wish had just closed down the shitty website and put all the cash into SPY these dudes would all be showing gain porn today.,
Put it all in AMZN yolo,
[deleted],
I'm starting to think that for ppl on wb money grow on trees.,
Tax loss harvesting for a lifetime,
How did your dumbass have so much money on the first place,
Ouch.  Respect for cutting the loss of a dead play.  Hope the next one goes better.

  (Maybe start your own online dildo shop instead of gambling on someone else's?),
That much blown on a mere WISH? 3x sector ETF play is the way to go once you have $1m.,
All time highs tomorrow confirmed.,
F,
I *wish* you the best of luck with your future investing to recover from this,
And I thought my -2K call was bad,
It looks like your wishes were not granted : ( Sorry dude,
You can right off 3k in your tax return,
Well that didn't age well...  
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qbxd7v/comment/hhdkn1h/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3,
Where do retards like this get a half a million dollars,
Ahhhh wish… the loss porn I can count on with consistency

Nice job OP👍🏾,
It will probably hit $20 next week,
And tomorrow is the day WISH goes +400%,
REALLY freaking glad I wussed out on that one.  I was about 75-25 on a YOLO when it was getting pimped on this board. 
Decided against it because of bad press about shipping from China having problems.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
How much do you have left? We need to consolidate it and come up with a trading strategy for December.,
This made my -40% loss of total account a lot better,
Can you help me get to your level?,
RIP,
Time to buy wish shares,
You do understand that under IRS rules this will give you a $3,000 annual tax deduction for each of the next 170 years?,
Buy the dip!!!!!! 🥴,
Who would have thought buying stock in an expensive version of Aliexpress that sells nothing but garbage and poor copies of things was a bad idea?,
Why sell,
I lost 3K and I was devastated, I was thinking “what am I?” After seeing this;),
I WISH you would've just gave me the money instead.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
lol this company was trash from the beginning, why would you invest in something with absolut no fundamentals,
Buy high. Sell low. Nice,
you could have bought 521,916 useless things on wish.,
That should make for interesting thanksgiving day conversation.,
I $WISH you the best, bro,
On the plus side, that's 174 years of loss carry-forwards on your taxes!,
Looks like someone got his WISH,
Reasonable commission of $6.84.  So not a total loss,
congrats can write off the losses for 173 years in current tax law 😪,
This is what I needed to see,  Just went all in. Thanks for the signal,
I don’t feel so bad about being down $1,500 anymore.,
If I had so much money I would have put it in quality stocks and already made 100K more :S,
If you can lose 500k, my girl can get over me losing 20k,
At least you’ll have that $3,000 loss write off for the next 166 years.,
At least you only paid $6.84 in fees🤪,
Skill issue,
You're still richer than me,
Why buddy? You could've literally bought a quality stock,
Thanks retard. Stock going to moon now just for this.,
christmas came early this year,
Just what I needed to cheer up today lol,
Back from bagholder to retard, congrats,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
I guess WISHes don't come true.,
Just hold,
Man you make me sick, what a dumb YOLO, god bless you sir,
You are a moron,
Atleast you won’t have any taxes this year lmao,
Let this be a lesson to you degenerates. Not everyone on here makes big money. In fact, the vast majority lose money. So stay in school and get a real job for solid income.,
Today is the day you wish never knew $WISH,

Get fucked greedy boomer,
The make a wish foundation does make money, what did you expect,
My condolences bro,
Basic 101 question… since you lost 500k did someone earn 500k in this transaction? Or did the “market” earn the 500k?,
This is actually sad..,
No tendies but a lot of handies,
u/cliquekilla omg,
Pamp eet,
If you were on RH, the loss would have been less. You could have saved $6.84 in commission & fees 😂,
I suggest this [thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/r0qm9g/how_we_should_start_to_see_the_autism_spectrum),
F,
On the plus side your commission was less than seven dollars!,
TAKE IT BOY!,
Its always the retards with their millions,
I'm sure that money be well spent on some nice odd gadgets.,
Any reason why you are selling today? Curious if you know something we don't ..,
It’s gonna go up now,
F,
 staaaahp you're making me horny! 😩,
You will not be forgotten. There will be a seat with your name on it with the other WSB gods in heaven.,
Why the hell would you buy stocks in a company like Wish,
What type of dent does this put on your overall wealth?,
I feel for u bro... I wouldnt take the entire loss in one year tho...

Offset any gains, assuming you have some and then carry the rest of the WISH loss to next year and keep doing that each year until u negate ur gains

Selling it all at once will just offset this years gains and will only allow u to write off 5k each year after that... its more of a win for the IRS than it is for u,
I lost $400 yesterday and its eating me alive. Thanks for the pick me up.,
Honestly, I don't understand Wish.

If you wanna buy things in Wish, why don't you buy in Ali Express,
I almost had a heart attack when I lost 1.5k.,
Wow, jizzed in my pants,
WHat is your next move?,
[deleted],
Congrats! Nothing like a locked-in tax deduction to prepare you for a Thanksgiving feast!,
F,
F,
Bummer man you'll bounce back,
See it's that $6.84 commission that's gettin ya right there.,
Dude Jan 2023 $15c were $6 like three months ago… you could’ve made like $500k just selling premium 🥲,
I trust the OP, but are all these “loss” posts legit ‘Cause these number are boggling my mind,
You had half a mil to lose.  I don’t feel bad for you.,
makes my 500 dollar loss not so bad, still pissed though,
It’s .05% green. Time to sell,
Buy Chinese, get Chinese,
at this point jst donate to a charity man,
Don’t come close to wish!  It’s a dead wish!,
Bro ouch . Idk what hurts more the comer of the bed banging on a pinky or you loss

Corner*,
This is a buy indication if I’ve ever seen one,
Big oof!,
Dass tut mir so leid Schwester. Viel Glück beim nächsten Mal,
I would shit my pants if i wasnt on a toilet,
Uncle Sam hates him.,
Here’s an award,
With 750k he could have BOUGHT a Wendy's franchise. 

Follow the logic, sell Wendy's to WSB traders, like tools to gold digger fools... 

It's so cunning...,
You idiot.,
HAHAHA,
At least your short-term gain ended in 69,
gg,
You followed a furu into battle and lost but the war can still be won. Make it back on the next trade.,
I wish I may, I wish I might, I wish I didn't lose half a mil on a Chinese knock off site.,
The president and I are proud of you!,
How can you make a loss from shares?,
I’m so confused why so many bought this company. Like do you even know what they do or their reputation? Their products are the worst shit ever. One person got a dead oyster with no preservatives as a “$5 pedal kit”. But I appreciate the nut so thank op.,
this dude don’t fuck.,
The dangers of buying into hype stocks "it's the next AMZN", fundamentals always corrects the price over time.,
There will always be a better play. Don’t worry,
Look on the bright side  - "Long Term Gain $0.00"

So it's a beginner's first time slipup. You may have lost half a fragging million, but the experience gained is totally huge. Dude - from now on you can **put it on your CV**. Up front.,
Gonna be one hell of a tax write off,
F,
Now it can finally go up,
I can definitely nut to this after bashing on WISH and CLOV for months, calling them pump and dumps.,
i mean. is this tax evasion?,
Sad you didn t buy more quality. I hope your job brings you a fortune,
Can anyone explain why this is not being supported by WSB and they so keep saying that this forum has no power to boost a stock or not because we truly have come to understand that retailers have more into them then the expected. When this gets to 20 will all have or rewards and yes WISH still can go to the moon if wanted.,
CEO living good while shareholders lose…. I stayed away from wish after seeing how they were spending money on a Wish la mansion/office.   It was ridiculous and a total waste of investor money. Literally, a party mansion. 

Then CEO drops 15 mill cash for his own home and I’m like no shame with these people.  

https://www.dirt.com/moguls/tech/peter-szylczewski-house-bel-air-1203291695/,
thanks for doing that, now i can sell mine for a smaller loss too afterwards.,
You did not lose anything, you just gained -$521,916.69,
I’m still holding so hoping you turn it around for me.,
true WSB moment that I come to find my WISH calls are tankning.,
Damn,
Congratulations mate. Who wants Christmas anyway?,
This does satisfy.,
Take care of yourself.,
Unfortunate,
Geez big fucking f my dude,
I'm really confused with that type of screenshot. Who ever works with flat amounts instead of percentages?,
"0.5M" lmao this dude desperately wants to be a millionaire.,
Should spread it out over years to never pay tax again lol,
This really makes me feel better about myself. I wish you well.,
Saving this and coming back in a few months,
Hey at least you retain some honor instead of being the dudes who try pumping it to drop their bags,
My stomach hurts from just looking at this,
Honestly you deserve it,
You dumb fuck,
Wow. Now I don’t feel so bad.,
So you took one for the team and  now it will shoot up next week, thanks,
God speed you degenerate,
It’s just 500k, don’t worry - wait till the next Covid mutation to make it back. 👀,
Could've been a lambo,
Half a milly on WISH jesus I thought I was retarted,
It's pretty hilarious to me just how badly this Zack Morris scammed people with $WISH. He's out there posting green P/L, 4m+ yet tells his followers "he's 100% still in"

How SEC hasn't come after that cuck yet...,
It’s going to tank again. I wouldn’t sweat it. I literally have money on it.,
Try deleting your account instead.,
yo degenerate might break even by going in on Tesla in maybe 10 years lol,

The fact that it’s $17 billion should open peoples minds to the fact that without these chips we ain’t shit. No economy, no blow jobs.,

Perfect, just in time to help with all the issues caused by semiconductor shortage!,
When they get listed on the us stock exchange I'm going to dump my entire portfolio on them.,
Are they going to put it right next to Tesla's Gigafactory? 👀,
TSM opening in AZ 2022/23,
I guess they know Taiwan is going to be a front line war zone,
Samsung is going to make the hardware 4.0 for FSD by Tesla. Cybertrucks are coming out with 4.0 already, so it's inevitable Texas is the best place to make a new factory for Samsung.. Even the steel for Cybertrucks will be provided by Steel Dynamics’ Sinton plant (in Texas ofc). In this case, the same steel will be used for SpaceX future Starships and Heavy Boosters. Maybe even Samsung chips will be used for Starlink and SpaceX as well. Texas is going to explode in the next years!,
Buying calls on Texas,
Yet another company building in TX. This ought to tell folks something.,
How’s that going to fare in the newly introduced yearly Texas winter storm blackouts tho,
Suprised they picked a state with a third world energy grid. I suppose they'll get some of that federal emergency money when it goes down again. Plus there's plenty of cheap labor to exploit there.,
Another profits over the social good story - move along,

2024-2025 could be a very interesting time between the USA and China and, as interconnected extension, the rest of the 'Western' world.  I doubt China will take it sitting down.  And I am guessing how it will play out will not be pretty.,

They'll stay and they'll dodge the audit regulations by stuffing a few pockets in DC,
Gotta get US investors' money for common prosperity,
Why am I not surprised.,
China gives the stick then the carrot...  
Then the stick again after, fool me once, fool me twice,
Also, the Chinese are the biggest hypocrites I have ever known.  
On one hand they trumpet that china is the best country in the world, the US is done and that the US is out to sabotage them.  


On the other hand they want to keep listing in the US market getting access to all that sweet capital.  Why don't the Chinese put their money where their mouth is? Go back to the Chinese exchange.,
This is huge, this mitigates some risk on my holdings of BABA, BIDU, JD and TCHEY,
If the Chinese economy is doing so great, why do they need money from US investors? Do US investors need to deal with more Evergrandes?,
I can't believe the SEC asks twice.  There's rules in place to protect investors.  Comply or hit the road Jack.,
NIO also affected or where are they listed?,
Prices are bouncing from support, time for the good news to come - new & old,

Stole is such a harsh word, maybe she’s just borrowing them,
That damn Plankton at it again.,
Now if that fucking dog at Bush’s will just accept my offer for 3x the money I could finally steal Bush’s baked bean recipe,
I remember when I thought the vaccine wouldn't have any "secrets," and all information was suppose to be shared for free for the benefit of humanity. That and the governments of the world would write a huge check so everyone that needs to be paid off get their money and move to the Panama islands so there wouldn't be anyone around to complain about stuff like this.

I don't think this will impact the stock price though.,

According to the article, the company Pfizer alleges to have a history of trying to poach clients is Xencor Inc., XNCR . Chun Xiao Li, the former employee who stole \~12,000 files from Pfizer, appears to work for them now.

If the allegations are true, whether she did it for the her new company or not, having that much confidential data stolen could have big consequences for Pfizer. Especially if there is damaging information regarding IP or methodology for development and approval.,
A vaccine secret... IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.,
Poor Pfizer,
Lol fuck Pfizer. They just petitioned to have data release of its vaccine until another 50 years. RIP. Here take(MANDATE) my product but you can’t sue me.,
Don’t have any empathy for pharma companies,
It's the Pfizermectin memo. *we already know it's the same shit*,
“We’re all in this together” until you start reaching into my wallet,
Puts on Pfizer then?,
So I should short Pfizer? Ahhh don't answer that,
A typical Chinese technology acquisition strategy, executed by a Chinese national.   


No surprises here, except that it was allowed to run for so long that we're now threatened by the very technology we allowed them to steal.,
Secret that their vax actually sterilizes people in three years?,
Was the secret that it doesn't work?,
Why? Even 2 jabs not enough anymore! Weak stuff compared to other vaccines,
We certainly wouldn't want anyone to know the secrets behind making a life saving vaccine.

That would just be dangerous.,
>Chun xiao lee

Employ chinese national to work on secret project.

Be surprised when they steal everything in exchange for a high paying job at a chinese rival firm back in china.,
Secrets?? 😮,
All that shit should be public anyways lol. Fuck ‘em.,
Fuck it give that shit out for free on the net staring johnny nemonic,
More like data it's data that makes the vaccine look worse.,
On the other side, china will make better vaccines now at cheaper prices...

Pfizer like any other farma have received billions of dollars in the development of medicines all paid by the taxpayers money but then sold it at huge profit and making medicine unaffordable for poor people... so fuck em,
I see nothing wrong here.  And in typical Pfizer fashion we wont see any price movement.,
Pharmaceutical companies are some of the scummiest least ethical fuckers out there. I'd rather break bread with killers and thieves than Pharmaceutical executives. But let's go get that 4th booster everyone. No way they're pushing it hard because their cash cow blue pill is about to have its patent expire.,
Here let’s sue the crap out of this person after we just made how many billions of dollars?,
A whistleblower?,
More like rightfully exposing the fact the vaccine is only effective at killing people by the tens of thousands!,
Vaccine was developed by Germany. Pfizer did own absolute nothing. FUCK AMERIKA,
Chun Li stole secrets and is going to a competitor? What is she leaving street fighter and going to mortal kombat? 🤣,
And China will suddenly have cheap and effective vaccines, as usual stolen ip and tech.,
[deleted],
Charles, why have we got that cage?,
Maybe she's idk, illuminating the issues with a multi billion, if not potentially trillion dollar cash grab by the major pharmaceutical players and the constituents they love to endorse,
I hope he took them to MRNA. Position Disclosure: + MRNA shares, short MRNA call.,

Pretty sure it just escaped from a lab on its own a bit like Covid,
Also that’s what happens if you employ bats,
...stole... wtf I thought we passes a law that they had to be transparent with each other... why the fuck are we keeping secrets for 😠,
hmm the secret recipe?,
As a person that was fully vaccinated by Pfizer and currently has COVID, I would say I hope they stole only the good parts,
What would Martin do?,
Are the secrets to activate the 5g chip in the vaccines?,
I wish they had just burned the entire shithole to the fucking ground,
