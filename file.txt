/u/LookAwayPuhlease (0/1) made a bet that F would go to 22.0 when it was 18.63 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.,

!banbet spy 500 2d 

Get me out of this sub lol.,
Lost 35k this week and got flagged as day trader. U win some boys but lose most.,
cant believe we were making fun of bears just this morning,
Today was a perfect example of why futures don’t matter. You can be up 2% at open and close 2% down. Literally no point in watching futures all night.,
SPY was 2% up and now more than -1% down.

so fucking crazy,
One of the many worst days in recent times,
12:15pm: "I think I'll nap. Armageddon is more fun when you wake up in it."

4:15pm: "Well, that was a nice nap. Are we in Armageddon yet?"

4:20pm: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
You know there is **at least one retard here** that did these moves in the last 5 trading days:  
  
1. Bought calls last Wednesday (Front running Santa rally)  
2. Switched to puts last Friday (Omicron fears)  
3. Switched to calls on Monday (Omicron being a nothingburger)  
4. Switched to puts yesterday (Jpow inflation comments)  
5. Switched to calls this morning (Seeing the Futures rally)  
6. Switched to puts at close today (first Omicron case in the US)  
  
Show up, because you deserved to be a mod here!,
Hypothetically, is it insider trading if I load up on a bunch of SPY puts, visit the New York Stock Exchange while I know I have the Omicron variant, and pass out in public?,
Game over. Insert coin to play again.,
If it's possible for a stock to go negative, my money is on WISH.,

/u/LlamaLlamaRedPajamaz (1/0) made a bet that SPY would go to 450.2 when it was 459.39 and it did, congrats fucker.,
This is my worst trading day since yesterday,
If your Robinhood order instantly fills, 

You better buy the inverse, quick.

Really works,
next time futures are up 1.5%, remind me to sell everything at market open,
Why do I have no motivation to do shit when it’s dark as hell at 5pm,
We saw a 14 point change in SPY in 1 day. Very healthy very cool,
Green futes .... woohoo bears ar.... damn I don't even have the energy anymore...,
Well...

I need to find $12,000 by Friday to buy these 457p back,
My stonks are RED 📈

My balls are BLUE 🔵

My wife has left me...

And now Margin is calling too 😭😭





... Fuk those gay gears 🧸🌈,
At least when stores run out of toilet paper in the next few days, I have these $PLTR shares to wipe my ass with.,

Is this the Christmas Rally?,
VIX is entering legit crash territory today. If it spikes again tomorrow we are not gonna have a good Christmas.,
We could gap up 3% tomorrow and I’d still be convinced we’ll end the day red.,
Tomorrow is either red or green. Thank me later,
when i blew up my account for the third time a month ago with SPY contracts , i told myself i was gonna take a long break and stick to swing trading shares. 

Well my four year relationship ended about a week ago and jerking off gives me limited euphoria so guess who’s back at the casino 😎 back to SPY calls and shitposting on the daily,
We are likely to see a short-term rally in the next week or so, but I'm probably going to offload a lot of positions into any sort of rally.

The biggest problem right now is just that the "smart money" is unloading at an unprecedented rate.  You have hedge funds reducing leverage substantially, insiders selling at an abnormal rate (some of it is tax considerations, but it's still big numbers), and it feels like retail is going to keep getting caught on the wrong side of these trades: see small caps/high growth the past month where everyone piled into those in late September/October expecting a small cap rally.

Retail is currently all piling into the 5-10 mega cap lifeboats, but if we see heavy selling there, could see a quick 5-7% plunge on everything in late December.

I think we're seeing a late 2018 redux but on a quicker timeline (think 6 weeks instead of 12 weeks).

It's just worth considering being a bit defensive the next couple of weeks because we're seeing extreme bearish sentiment while mega caps are still near (or even at in the case of AAPL) all time highs.

Of course, the counter to all of this is that most of the "negatives" are starting to be baked into the cake: first case of Omicron in the US, dramatically faster tapering being priced into bond yields, etc.

But I just feel as if we're seeing mega caps repeat what we saw happen to small caps in October..., why would that end differently?

If you're going to go long here, give the position time to breathe, might have to look to late January calls or beyond to at least prevent yourself from getting caught.,
Some of you have never lost 25K in a day before and it shows,
My asshole may never fully close again,
Had 80k put guy not been such a pussy he’d be looking at 150k in his account right now.,
2018:  Cars lose half their value as soon as you drive off the lot.   Stocks only go up. 

2021: Stocks lose half their value as soon as I buy them.  Used cars sell at new prices.,
Honestly think this market has ruined me. Financially and mentally. Have been doing this full time two years. Last year was great, now I’m legit red for the year. I had many chances too but nope just kept holding my calls too long or selling the gold ones too fucking early. Wow this hurts. I feel so unmotivated. I’m a loser,
Roommate came to my room, said he heard a bunch of people applauding. But it was just me getting my cheeks clapped  👏,
Who else lost 5(+)% today? 🩸

🖐,
My wife is going to leave me,
If your still here and not wiped out yet, congratulations: we will now be entering the next stage,
Lost $10k last year. Recovered all and got $8k on top of it this year, only to lose $20k this year. The fuck,
Sold a spy put for $83 dollars today that ended up being worth $711 at close, fml 🤦‍♀️,
I buy calls ... stock crashes.  I buy puts..stocks fkn skyrocket.   I fkn give up.,

All of this with Nasdaq still just 4% away from all time highs  
  
I swear, we need to make Cathie a mod here. She has earned it!,
It use to be "buy calls on this dip."

now everyone by like "buy puts on this rally",
So for all the people who said they wished they started trading when covid crashed the markets in 2019 because they would have timed the dip and went all in at the bottom… let’s see you time the bottom this time…,
Tomorrow: a second case of the virus was found in America. Stonks dump another -4%.,

Green futures. Fooled me once, shame on you. Fool me 29 times, shame on me.,
wait a min, I slept at 1pm today and i just woke up.  SPY was up 1.6 %, but now i am bankrupted .

WTF,
+75k at open to -180k at close,
Zillow used to send me monthly updates on zestimate of my house but they didn't this month. They must be embarrassed.,
Feeling cute. May blow up my account tomorrow, idk.,
Someone on Twitter posted a screenshot saying circus clowns make $67k/ year on avg and then tagged Jim Cramer and asked if it was true lmfao,
I think I was happier back in prison.,
Build a bear being up 27 % today is surely a sign right? 😂,
I deposited 3 grand on monday, its gone today lmao,
I’m hedging against taxes by taking 3k losses everyday this week.,
This is actually like, worse than September LOL,
The air feels different when everything is crashing and you have puts. This must be how gay feels. I like it c:,
I’m utterly wrecked by the last 3 weeks. I don’t know what to do now.,
I pretty much need a 5% gain on SPY by next Friday, or I'm probably never going to be able to have the money to trade again.  


Which, y'know, may be a blessing. Just give up my dreams of riches and accept that my retirement plan really is just a bottle of liquor and a tall building.,
Amc is a cult,
mods, if 50k put guy tries to come back and post gain porn, please ban him immediately. bitch ass mofo deleting his post when it goes down.,
buddy of mine was up like 40% this year on 9K principle doing his gambling stock theta plays (selling CCs and cash secured puts) and is now down like 5% for the year.

He basically went from a 12K account to 8K just on shares. Yikes.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) wasnt spy up 2%? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) why did everything get clapped? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),

I’ve just been blankly staring at the wall since market close,
I'm making so much money in this market, is something I wish I could say.,

This Omicron stuff is stupid, but this knife is getting to sharp for me to catch. I can't help but to think what would happen if we had actual bad news.,
fuck this market. Not selling, all or nothing,
Futures will be extremely green. But they don’t mean shit so get ready for another bloodbath tomorrow,
I asked my wife if we could have sex tonight. She said the only thing I’m fucking is stupid,
had a friend recently get into options trading. He said he was up 20% on a call but he had to let it expire because he didn’t know how to sell it. 

I’ve never laughed so fucking hard,

This sub is officially more bearish than any other time in 2021,
People will post a move they made and call it a “20-bagger” then I’ll look up the option price and it’s up like 70%. Are we all on the same page as how many units a bagger is?,

green futes lmao here we go again,
The year is 2420. SPY has been ripping back and forth between 450 and 465 every day for like 400 years. You wake up, put your helmet on, and plug yourself into the Robinhood(TM) metaverse for another day of alternating between panic selling and euphoria.  You haven't left your pod in months. What a rush. 

SPY opens at 450 and immediately starts blasting green dildos. You take a long slurp of soy-product through your feeding tube and turn your extra small fleshlight to "maximum-stim." You were born for this shit. Today's gonna be a great day.,

Some of you guys really do be shilling with zero imagination.

Tell me a story. Paint me a picture. spy calls. Bring me to your happy place and let me in. that ass.

I mean really, if you want to sell something. Fucking sell it with conviction.

I want to Kiss Ryan Gosling,
In the last 2 weeks I've lost all my gains during the epic rally starting back in October which had saved all of my losses from the September pullback. Back to square 1 basically. Spent so much time trying to improve my strategies and risk management yet I'm back where I started somehow,
These Dec SPY calls are feelin heavy bros,

Market: Well that’s too damn bad!,
Goddamn I never take profits,
Well that was fucking BAD. 

Have we seen a sell-off that bad since the pandemic started? Maybe September 3rd 2020. Any other time since? 

What are the bullish arguments at this point? Considering that Omicron is probably just a catalyst and not the driving force behind the sell off...,
80% of the stocks were in bear market anyways. Now the remaining 20% will join them.,
Guys, Friday was puts, Monday was Calls, Tuesday was puts, Today was Calls, then puts, so tomorrow will be puts then calls.

Serious question - what is the catalyst bulls expect for SPY going back to ATH say any timeframe longer than a month? 

We already heard the truth from the fed. Tapering schedule is moving up which means rate hikes will be moved up ahead of schedule as well. Inflation must be combated. 

The Omnicron variant is nothing more than the current scapegoat to create bag holders as they run for the exit in the coming months.,

I’ll be damned if we break 200D. This is definitely a correction. It is unrelated to virus or any other BS reasons being claimed by the media. It’s nothing more than a healthy 5-7% correction.

Most of you probably don't remember March 2020 because you were still finishing middle school. But, to paint a picture of what is possible, the market did limit up on futures during the crash.,
WSB is too doom and gloom tonight. 

I'm actually wondering if futures are accurate for once.,
Who drinking? WHO IS DRUNK WITH ME!?,
This is the worst kind of market right now, reminds me of September somewhat when vix was around this range: obviously premiums are prohibitively overpriced, but even worse, the market is making the majority of it's daily moves overnight. So you have to hold options overnight to capture the move, but its a coin flip if we gap up or down the next day. 

Which then leads to me asking myself why the fuck I wasn't in cash sooner, but the daily bull/bear traps have been too hard to resist. I truly feel like a retard this past week,

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,

ALEXA, CAN YOU PLAY BUY THE MOTHERFUCKING DIP BY JPOW,
SOMEONE TELL ME WHY I SHOULDNT FULL PORT ZUMIEZ PUTS,
Hey americans tell me about dollar general is it retail that is struggling? I missed Gap and Nordstrom because my bank did not have short options on them so I’m looking to short general if it’s retails.,
Looking at Box before earnings. What we thinking?,
What do you all think about calls right before closing on salesforce,
smith and weston yolo initiated,
What’s the play for $SNOW and $DOCU?,
Yes!!!,
AMBA fueling up !!,
Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,
Earnings are useless this week. Sorry bruh,
Nothing interesting at least for me.,
Calls on JNCO Jeans,
Hmmm calls on CRWD a good move? Looks like ZS had good earnings but valuation seems real high,
Every "crisis" we have had over the past decade is one step back three step forward for the stock markets.,
put season,
With today’s sell off, SNOW calls are very attractive 🚀🚀🚀,
There has to be some rotation back into some of these stocks that are getting absolutely crushed.,
I have heard of 6 companies on this list.,
why didn't I play snowflake. I have never heard of it and I'm in tech.,
Puts on SNOW. This company is priced at an insane price to sales for building cloud databases (60s tech but on the cloud). Even a slight miss and this is plummeting.,
DIDNT WE AGREE WE WERENT DOING THIS BULLSHIT ANYMORE?,
Ulta %20 otm puts for like 5$ hope for a %30 drop bank on 100x loto,
Snow. Up or down?,
CRM is a must buy after today’s pullback 🚀🚀🚀🚀,
CRWD melting is making me wonder about my 200p 12/3s.,
SNOW beats, plus $40 after hours,
There’s always money in the banana stand
$dole,
No cool stocks,
Hope ASAN tank like PTON,
Put on lucid?,
$GFS, really interested to see their earnings. I’m primarily bearish on the company but this earnings could be a huge trajectory shift for them,
I just be it all on LCID puts. Am I fuxd?,
$CRWD has to be a no brainer based on $ZS sympathy? Going to grab a few lottos at close.,
Banked good from day trading CRWD puts today and closed it before earnings 

What’s a good day trade for options tomorrow?,
Someone posted bzun puts are easy money. Cheap too. Thoughts?,
Jinko hoe,
[removed],
So we’re down to Cybersecurity cos, Snowflake, & DocuSign basically. 

Lots going on in the market without earnings though,
29nd.,

Jinko jeans were my favorite in high school,
Puts on all. Every day all day,
$SWBI is the short and long term play my apes. P/E ratio is 5 or something. Fear of lockdowns will pump it this week,
Fuck. Should've bought Ulta when I had the chance.,
Not "most anticipated", but I have high hopes for JOAN on Dec 2nd,
Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,
Calls on Zscaler? They seem to have increased hiring of late.,
I‘m new. What can I do with that information?,
Ispc on monday 🚀🚀🚀🎰🎰🎉🎉,
HP spinoff HPE looks interesting Tue. amc. HP did well last week, HPE should be terrific also.,
gonna pump up some Chico’s! lol nobody’s clothing fits and they have a lot of “free size” stuff,

"It do go down" 😂🤣😂 Classic video!,
It was amazing how quickly that announcement just tanked everything.,
When you buy the dip but it just keeps dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),

I went from +1500 USD to -3000 USD and a spam of margin calls from my broker.. Ahh shit, here we go again,
See y’all on the other side son! 😂,
r/gifsthatendtoosoon,

I've never seen past this point of this video. Anyone have the extended version?,
If Ive learned anything from our little adventures this year, it's that Im happier shorting bad stock than longing any good ones....,
Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,
I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative. 

What the fuck is going on?,
It's fucking CRM down 11 percent,
it go down,

Does anyone know what happens after the vid cuts off? Always wondered what happened,
Now this is a quality meme.,
Apparently it do go down. Glad for once I wasn’t retarded and closed my calls for a 10% loss instead of holding. Then I bought puts.. Anyone else fuck up on puts today? Had to leave for work at 145pm ish, closed my 12/3 462P’s when SPY hit 458 🤡,
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I’d lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man… when it lets me f*ck… Christ… it’s pretty glorious.,
It doooo go dowwwwwn!,

Fucking Cathie Wood. Losing my real IRA money. Good thing I still have some money in voo and bnd. Not selling my ark funds but prob won't touch them for 10 years and maybe they will bounce back. Maybe I will buy more while it's down. Idk. I'm just an ape.,
I lost so much money today....I just stopped looking at it,
The stone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886),
Shit I looked at it earlier in the day and saw that it was fine. Didn't know it dropped again.

Apparently it was because of Omicron? How? How does the market drop like 3 times from 3 announcements of Omicron existing. Like we get it, there's a variant. Doesn't have to be breaking news every day lol,
Thank god I’m cash heavy right now. I’m gonna be buying heavy while things are on sale,

Congratulations, now please go yolo in tsm like me!,
nice, I remember doing covered calls with AMD when it was around 80 dollars and it just got assigned sometime in summer at around 100 and I thought "meh it won't keep going up" and boy am I a fucking moron.,
Perfect timing I just bought it yesterday,
https://i.imgur.com/eTM17eJ.jpg  I see your 700% and raise you my 947%!,
Bruh god damn,
Stay blessed king,
Can't be mad about that! We can... but you can't. Congrats retard.,
I jumped in at the low 70s and dipped at the high 80s. I thought I did pretty well and then looked at it a few weeks later and it was sitting in the 100s haha.

Good for you man, all mine have expired worthless. Please don’t tell the wife’s boyfriend I lost all his money.,
I touch myself,
Keep the $280 call,
total newb, can someone explain what's going on here? I think I understand the mechanics of a long call – you buy the option to buy at a set price. But I'm not understanding the figures in the 'Position' column (the amount of options bought at that $?) and how it corresponds to the total cost.

Does this basically mean /u/CaspeanSea was buying calls for December in January?,
Congratulatory and obligatory fuck you :),
Smart man. Congrats on that. Im pissed at myself for selling my shares at 45bucks. Big mistake.,
If  it is good enough to screen shot, it is good enough to sell.
