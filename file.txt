!banbet spy 500 2d 

Get me out of this sub lol.,
Lost 35k this week and got flagged as day trader. U win some boys but lose most.,
cant believe we were making fun of bears just this morning,
Today was a perfect example of why futures don‚Äôt matter. You can be up 2% at open and close 2% down. Literally no point in watching futures all night.,
SPY was 2% up and now more than -1% down.

so fucking crazy,
One of the many worst days in recent times,
12:15pm: "I think I'll nap. Armageddon is more fun when you wake up in it."

4:15pm: "Well, that was a nice nap. Are we in Armageddon yet?"

4:20pm: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553),
You know there is **at least one retard here** that did these moves in the last 5 trading days:  
  
1. Bought calls last Wednesday (Front running Santa rally)  
2. Switched to puts last Friday (Omicron fears)  
3. Switched to calls on Monday (Omicron being a nothingburger)  
4. Switched to puts yesterday (Jpow inflation comments)  
5. Switched to calls this morning (Seeing the Futures rally)  
6. Switched to puts at close today (first Omicron case in the US)  
  
Show up, because you deserved to be a mod here!,
Hypothetically, is it insider trading if I load up on a bunch of SPY puts, visit the New York Stock Exchange while I know I have the Omicron variant, and pass out in public?,
Game over. Insert coin to play again.,
If it's possible for a stock to go negative, my money is on WISH.,

/u/LlamaLlamaRedPajamaz (1/0) made a bet that SPY would go to 450.2 when it was 459.39 and it did, congrats fucker.,
This is my worst trading day since yesterday,
If your Robinhood order instantly fills, 

You better buy the inverse, quick.

Really works,
next time futures are up 1.5%, remind me to sell everything at market open,
Why do I have no motivation to do shit when it‚Äôs dark as hell at 5pm,
We saw a 14 point change in SPY in 1 day. Very healthy very cool,
Green futes .... woohoo bears ar.... damn I don't even have the energy anymore...,
Well...

I need to find $12,000 by Friday to buy these 457p back,

Is this the Christmas Rally?,
VIX is entering legit crash territory today. If it spikes again tomorrow we are not gonna have a good Christmas.,
We could gap up 3% tomorrow and I‚Äôd still be convinced we‚Äôll end the day red.,
Tomorrow is either red or green. Thank me later,
when i blew up my account for the third time a month ago with SPY contracts , i told myself i was gonna take a long break and stick to swing trading shares. 

Well my four year relationship ended about a week ago and jerking off gives me limited euphoria so guess who‚Äôs back at the casino üòé back to SPY calls and shitposting on the daily,
We are likely to see a short-term rally in the next week or so, but I'm probably going to offload a lot of positions into any sort of rally.

The biggest problem right now is just that the "smart money" is unloading at an unprecedented rate.  You have hedge funds reducing leverage substantially, insiders selling at an abnormal rate (some of it is tax considerations, but it's still big numbers), and it feels like retail is going to keep getting caught on the wrong side of these trades: see small caps/high growth the past month where everyone piled into those in late September/October expecting a small cap rally.

Retail is currently all piling into the 5-10 mega cap lifeboats, but if we see heavy selling there, could see a quick 5-7% plunge on everything in late December.

I think we're seeing a late 2018 redux but on a quicker timeline (think 6 weeks instead of 12 weeks).

It's just worth considering being a bit defensive the next couple of weeks because we're seeing extreme bearish sentiment while mega caps are still near (or even at in the case of AAPL) all time highs.

Of course, the counter to all of this is that most of the "negatives" are starting to be baked into the cake: first case of Omicron in the US, dramatically faster tapering being priced into bond yields, etc.

But I just feel as if we're seeing mega caps repeat what we saw happen to small caps in October..., why would that end differently?

If you're going to go long here, give the position time to breathe, might have to look to late January calls or beyond to at least prevent yourself from getting caught.,
Some of you have never lost 25K in a day before and it shows,
My asshole may never fully close again,
Had 80k put guy not been such a pussy he‚Äôd be looking at 150k in his account right now.,
2018:  Cars lose half their value as soon as you drive off the lot.   Stocks only go up. 

2021: Stocks lose half their value as soon as I buy them.  Used cars sell at new prices.,
Honestly think this market has ruined me. Financially and mentally. Have been doing this full time two years. Last year was great, now I‚Äôm legit red for the year. I had many chances too but nope just kept holding my calls too long or selling the gold ones too fucking early. Wow this hurts. I feel so unmotivated. I‚Äôm a loser,
Roommate came to my room, said he heard a bunch of people applauding. But it was just me getting my cheeks clapped  üëè,
Who else lost 5(+)% today? ü©∏

üñê,
My wife is going to leave me,
If your still here and not wiped out yet, congratulations: we will now be entering the next stage,
Lost $10k last year. Recovered all and got $8k on top of it this year, only to lose $20k this year. The fuck,
Sold a spy put for $83 dollars today that ended up being worth $711 at close, fml ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,

It use to be "buy calls on this dip."

So for all the people who said they wished they started trading when covid crashed the markets in 2019 because they would have timed the dip and went all in at the bottom‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs see you time the bottom this time‚Ä¶,

I pretty much need a 5% gain on SPY by next Friday, or I'm probably never going to be able to have the money to trade again.

Realized 22k in losses today. These weren't just for today alone. These were shares that I've stubbornly bagheld for months. It doesn't matter what I do. Vanilla OTM FD gambling, theta, shares, I always lose short term investments. It's so frustrating. I'm close deciding to just buy some shares of AMD, AAPL and other relatively safe companies, and not checking my account for a decade. In the meantime, I'll probably have to update my software engineering skills and actually look for a job like some wageslave.,

I sent the picture and description to the police, in San Jose. Notorious for human trafficking

I want to Kiss Ryan Gosling,
In the last 2 weeks I've lost all my gains during the epic rally starting back in October which had saved all of my losses from the September pullback. Back to square 1 basically. Spent so much time trying to improve my strategies and risk management yet I'm back where I started somehow,
These Dec SPY calls are feelin heavy bros,

Market: Well that‚Äôs too damn bad!,
Goddamn I never take profits,
Well that was fucking BAD. 

Have we seen a sell-off that bad since the pandemic started? Maybe September 3rd 2020. Any other time since? 

What are the bullish arguments at this point? Considering that Omicron is probably just a catalyst and not the driving force behind the sell off...,
80% of the stocks were in bear market anyways. Now the remaining 20% will join them.,
Guys, Friday was puts, Monday was Calls, Tuesday was puts, Today was Calls, then puts, so tomorrow will be puts then calls.

How are you guys not rich?,
This week is really good, I‚Äôm already up -270% of all time,
Opened up 77k worth of SPX puts on 11/1 for Dec 17 and watched it theta decay slowly for a month, finally exited with 50% gains today, got 150k in cash gang,

Serious question - what is the catalyst bulls expect for SPY going back to ATH say any timeframe longer than a month? 

We already heard the truth from the fed. Tapering schedule is moving up which means rate hikes will be moved up ahead of schedule as well. Inflation must be combated. 

The Omnicron variant is nothing more than the current scapegoat to create bag holders as they run for the exit in the coming months.,

Yesterday was high af on shrooms and found myself being attracted to my reflection in the mirror, and then I had to check if I was male or female, and was relieved to find a dick in my pants, but at the same time, it left me wondering about something: does this whole scenario make me a bear?,
I‚Äôll be damned if we break 200D. This is definitely a correction. It is unrelated to virus or any other BS reasons being claimed by the media. It‚Äôs nothing more than a healthy 5-7% correction.

Most of you probably don't remember March 2020 because you were still finishing middle school. But, to paint a picture of what is possible, the market did limit up on futures during the crash.,
WSB is too doom and gloom tonight. 

I'm actually wondering if futures are accurate for once.,
Who drinking? WHO IS DRUNK WITH ME!?,
This is the worst kind of market right now, reminds me of September somewhat when vix was around this range: obviously premiums are prohibitively overpriced, but even worse, the market is making the majority of it's daily moves overnight. So you have to hold options overnight to capture the move, but its a coin flip if we gap up or down the next day. 

Which then leads to me asking myself why the fuck I wasn't in cash sooner, but the daily bull/bear traps have been too hard to resist. I truly feel like a retard this past week,

50k+ in CRWD leaps that I'll hold thru earnings (mix of Jan 23 and (Jan 24 calls).

They'll probably do okay but really depends on market sentiment (which are not so good for growth recently) for post ER movements.

If the growth narrative holds and sentiment shifts, can easily rocket back to high 280s-300.

If not, be prepare for low 200s.

Been trading CRWD decently for the past year and with recent action I'm glad I paper handed the gains as it's YTD is once again mixed/lagging indexes.

And if you enjoy the conspiracy memes Pelosi's husband bought in at 120s last Sept. So based on that alone it'll +20% ez this earnings! (Cuz reasons).,
Time to just randomly guess if supply chain is an issue or not for many of these. Open the casino,

Red Week vibes from these guys,
BRP has sold every sea-doo, ski-doo, can-am, etc. They have made the past 2 years and are taking orders into 2023. HOWEVER, they cancelled evinrude right in the middle of the highest boat sales in decades, haven't significantly upped production of any of their current powersports products despite being able to sell probably %50-100 more than what they're producing, and layed off employees due to covid despite record sales and orders.

The powersports market was so Bullish but I can't be on BRP with their management.,

AMBA fueling up !!,
Can someone explain to me how does SNOW earning reports even work?

I'm looking at this link >> https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/snow/earnings

And it says SNOW reported their 2021 Q3 earnings at -0.5 estimated and -0.63 actual. Meaning they missed their earnings by 26%.

But then marketbeat >> https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SNOW/earnings/

Is saying last quarter report is actually 0.04 estimated and 0.15 actual? That they actually had positive EPS instead of negative unlike what the NASDAQ website shows? And they actually reported their earnings for 2022 Q2 last quarter instead of the one that ends in the fiscal month of July 2021

How the fuck does that even work. Confused,
Earnings are useless this week. Sorry bruh,
Nothing interesting at least for me.,
Calls on JNCO Jeans,
Hmmm calls on CRWD a good move? Looks like ZS had good earnings but valuation seems real high,
Every "crisis" we have had over the past decade is one step back three step forward for the stock markets.,

Not "most anticipated", but I have high hopes for JOAN on Dec 2nd,
Any thoughts on $SMAR? I think that It doesn't really fit in the "corona pandemic/home office boom" stock category like Zoom or Peloton but surelly feels like one, has already tanked last earnings (Q2/2022) and hasn't really recoverd since then. It could repeat the pattern from last year, where it also tanked after Q2/2021 and went up after Q3/2021, or not....,

Its not like the US will shutdown again so it shouldn't affect much other that hospitals/pharma. Yeah i know the people who get sick i gotcha. Other than that it really shouldn't even hit us that hard,
I like (hate) how every day this week it rallies out the gate and then by the bell all gains are depleted and back into the negative.

Apparently it do go down. Glad for once I wasn‚Äôt retarded and closed my calls for a 10% loss instead of holding. Then I bought puts.. Anyone else fuck up on puts today? Had to leave for work at 145pm ish, closed my 12/3 462P‚Äôs when SPY hit 458 ü§°,
Crash you pos. I cashed out most of my stuff a couple months ago.,
Bought 3 158 puts at $.70 this morning expiring today. Then right before I left for lunch - SPY was trading +7 on the day I was down over $100 for the 8th trading day in a row  so I did the same thing any other ape on a losing streak would do and I averaged down to 10 puts @ 158 after buying some for like .06-.07. Went and ate chick fil a and practiced my upcoming presentation a bit. Came back from lunch an hour later and started walking back in the building - pulled out my phone and SPY HAD WENT KAPLUNK while I was chilling. Sold all 10 puts @ $1.02 a piece and made back what I‚Äôd lost slowly over the last week and a half. 
SPY usually f*cks me but man‚Ä¶ when it lets me f*ck‚Ä¶ Christ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty glorious.,

I‚Äôve had AMD for years and it‚Äôs been a wild ride. I liquidated my original investment worth a couple times over and still have 3x riding,
You sold high? What‚Äôs wrong with you?,
Congratulations that‚Äôs awesome‚Ä¶and fuck you,
May your wifes boyfriend buy the car he has always wanted.,
Good for u bro. Now take some of that out and buy urself something nice before ur next yolo lol.,
‚ÄúAnd what happened, then? Well, in r/wallstreetbets they say ‚Äì that u/CaspeanSea 's smooth brain grew three wrinkles that day. And then ‚Äì the true meaning of being retarded came through, and u/CaspeanSea found the account of 5 baggers, plus two!‚Äù,
Congratulations, now please go yolo in tsm like me!,
nice, I remember doing covered calls with AMD when it was around 80 dollars and it just got assigned sometime in summer at around 100 and I thought "meh it won't keep going up" and boy am I a fucking moron.,
Perfect timing I just bought it yesterday,
https://i.imgur.com/eTM17eJ.jpg  I see your 700% and raise you my 947%!,
Bruh god damn,
Stay blessed king,
Can't be mad about that! We can... but you can't. Congrats retard.,
I jumped in at the low 70s and dipped at the high 80s. I thought I did pretty well and then looked at it a few weeks later and it was sitting in the 100s haha. 

Oh well, be glad for the money you made. Not mad at the money you didn't.,
Today I lost 66,000 on my main ccount. glad to see you took the opposite side of my bet. proper job,
Now Short it and really double dip  üòçüòç,
Smart, I will take it from here(Got in at $158). I am ok though I am a professional bagHolder, it's what I do.,
Well done sir,
I had these same calls, doubled my account since September. Congrats man,
One of my NCOs bought 10000 shares of AMD when it was 2 a share back in January 2018. He is still holding,
Can u get the mods to give u an AMD BULL flair or something?,
watch it go up 7000% after you sell all,
I think some people meant to buy and AMD and accidentally bought AMC,
Congratulations bro, let me know if you want to start a small cap garage investment firm.,

How dare you post something green that isn't a robinhood loss!,
Good for you man, all mine have expired worthless. Please don‚Äôt tell the wife‚Äôs boyfriend I lost all his money.,
I touch myself,
Keep the $280 call,
total newb, can someone explain what's going on here? I think I understand the mechanics of a long call ‚Äì you buy the option to buy at a set price. But I'm not understanding the figures in the 'Position' column (the amount of options bought at that $?) and how it corresponds to the total cost.

Does this basically mean /u/CaspeanSea was buying calls for December in January?,
Congratulatory and obligatory fuck you :),
Smart man. Congrats on that. Im pissed at myself for selling my shares at 45bucks. Big mistake.,
If  it is good enough to screen shot, it is good enough to sell.

Wtf? Take profit?

Can someone ELI5 the concept of taking profit?,
Well fucking done brah,
Should I keep my $135c 2023? The market is starting to worry me, I‚Äôm up a lot though.,
One should never argue with profit! Congratulations Sir,
When did you initiate the position and did you average down?,
Nice, had the $90 calls, got weak hands and sold at $50. Still have my shares though.,
That's some nice juicy profit you got  there. Christmas is coming up, better start shopping for your wife's BF.,
Consider yourself realized you fucker! Cheers,
U sold early bro,
What a good timing. Good job.,
amazing when did you originally buy the calls?,
Wow whateverrr,
Sold before the Xilinex deal?,
I wonder how many times I shorted all y'all,
Congratulations and fuck you.,
Alright guys, buy in, AMD to $5T in 3 years.,
How much of a tax bill does this run you? Just curious.,
Desktop metals has been getting shorted hard. Could be a good one to take for a run,
Ive been sitting on mine since it was $5/share. It is too bad I didn't buy wayyy more. =/,
OP send $800 bucks for my rent. Thanks.,
