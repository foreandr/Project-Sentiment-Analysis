Ipo forecasted to hit November 25th. Also they reported $1B losses in first half of the year,
I believe the new low is at $3300.,
I just bought some AMZN $3450/$3460c February 2022 debit spreads.  


The last earnings have been pretty negative. AMZN currently sits beaten down pretty far from it's all time high. I think this earnings if they are good will send it up.,
I have only read on Reddit rumors that AMZN may be compelled by Monopoly Trust regulations to sell-off AWS and that AWS would spin off like Paypal had from eBay.  


Have you heard the same?   
I would imagine it would leave AMZN less valuable.  


Funny how Bezos left and the stock has been flat since its run up in 2020.

Its still a very valuable company with tons of revenue and profit.   
I think holding and buying more is less risky than selling over the next 5yrs.,
Over the past year, it’s seemed to have bounced between 3180 and 3550 pretty regularly.  So when it hits the low, I get calls, and when it hits the other, I sell and buy puts.  Have done ok.,
What do you think about AMZN after today's earnings?,
This stock has been flat for years 

The hilarity about this are the analyst forecasts every year of 4000-4900 a share

Fair value is below 3000

Like apple and their 6 billion hit we are being told and controlled by the analysts to shrug it off (until they hit sell)

When a stock hits VERY rough patches like aapl & amzn recently and doesn’t sell off you should be very worried about increasing positions at these prices and you should take some profit imo

No crystal balls here just common sense 

When squid game fake money is up 2000% and dog money goes boom you should be very wary about the overall market despite Ari Gilvert,
If the debt limit ceiling by this week coming up there will be a government shutdown and in that case the market pullback so much it won’t even be funny,
SPLIT the STOCK.,
Nope. Jeff isn’t interested. And he is chair of the board. The board has to approve such a move.,
Nope,
Heard through the grape vine Berkshire Hathaway may join the mix,
I think it is rebounding boys.,
Why are you throwing money away?

McKenzie is selling off a billion dollars worth a month and will continue to for the next few years.

AMZN is going to remain pretty much pinned until she is done.,
Strike price?,
I wish I could afford even one AMZN dec call. Played myself on weeklies,
I am just holding my first buy and then i just keep shorting on day to day basis. Gotta re-coup my losses. T-T,
